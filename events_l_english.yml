 CoariIntroduction.1.d:0 "The River of Gold, the Land of Gas, River of the Gods, The Pearl of Solimões; Those are all names once given to the city of Coari the 5th largest and one of the most isolated towns in northern Brazil, located just west of Manaus in the dense heart of the Amazon rainforest, but what makes this city shine is also came to be it's own downfall, following the 1962 military coup against President João Goulart and the following civil war that still rages on, Coari came to be one of the cities occupied by the Amazonian Military Command, one of the Brazilian Army's regional defence forces, in an effort to maintain peace and loyalty to the central government during a time of crisis.\n \nIn 1965 however with the prolongment of the war, infighting between Junta and Loyalist forces in the Amazonian Military Command and the lack of men in the southern frontlines, the AMC was recalled from Coari and the Amazon as a whole, stationed only in Manaus and Belém, however their mark stayed behind.\n \nBe it for lack of supervision, overdeployment or undersupplying of troops or a combination of all, but the army's treatment of the civilian population got harsher by the day, beatings on the streets were common and sporadic fire was heard around the city between local armed civilians, loyalist and Junta aligned soldiers, civilians were caught in the crossfire, their final gift to the city being the cursed of March 1st 1965, 3 days before the troops retreat from the the Amazon and 1 day before the start of the Carnaval season, during a communal dinner organized by the local church as a departure gift for the soldiers.\n \nUnbeknowst to all, liquor got smuggled in, men got drunk, tensions escalated and soon blood was shed, and by the end of the night the Solimões river reflected the orange light of the burning city.\n \nThe pillaging carried on for a day, few houses were spared, women were stripped from their husbands and children; The following day the soldiers departed earlier then expected, carrying with them trophies as if taken from life long enemy's homes, and the Pearl was left behind without it's shine, glow or shell."
