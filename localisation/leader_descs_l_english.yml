During the 60s with the fall of rubber prices in Brazil him and his fellow rubber tappers found themselves employed and exploited by many rich land owners, and facing this situation, Wilson began advocating for worker's rights in Acre, where he worked at. After WW3 and the following civil war in Brazil, Wilson was contacted by Guevarist officials and told to hold an armed insurgency in the state of Acre; this revolt failed horribly, and faced with possible execution Souza fled north to Roraima and by chance met with Onofre Pinto and together made a new revolution, the Roraima Worker's Front.

As an old man in '61 he was elected again as mayor after a long hiatus from politics as if destiny itself put him in charge of his beloved little town once again in a time of desperation. During Coari's sacking on March 1st 1965 his reign almost came to a bloody end if not for the civilian mob that surrounded and protected him and his office during the chaos, a showcase of the people's gratitude and love for him. To anyone outside of the now desolate city this may seem... weird, but the undeniable only reason Coari still stands, even if only half alive, is the presence and guidance of this well dressed man."

 BEM_JARBAS_PASSARINHO_DESC:0 "Born in Xapuri, Acre, in January 11th 1920 to a small business owner and a housewife, Jarbas Passarinho never settled down. Moving to Porto Alegre in the south of the country when he was just 11 years old, and later to Rio de Janeiro to prepare for a military career, he never found himself a place to call his own. \nHe was an army officer when the Brazilian Armed Forces attempted a coup, which rendered him a lot of power and influence inside the junta, eventually joining the ARENA (National Renewal Alliance). Now, with Castelo Branco's appointment of Jarbas as the military governor of Pará, maybe he'll have a small chiefdom and perhaps, a home. If only his home wasn't on fire and under constant attacks from natives and guerrilas, that is."
 ACR_PROVISIONAL_DESC:0 "After the fall of Edgar Cerqueira's cabinet, and Che's attack on the young republic's borders, an emergency government was formed to secure stability and prosperity to the country. \n \nUnfortunately, ever since its inception, the provisional government has been in a gridlock, and not much progress has been made.

He grew in the military scenario quickly, using his political connections and brilliant strategism, he eventually won the title General of the §GAmazonian Military Command§!. \n \nDespite being put there by the Junta, Rodrigo became disillusioned with them after their brutal crackdown on the §RAraguaia Guerrilla§!, turning his military branch into a neutral zone, balancing carefully between both the Republic and the Junta. \nThis neutrality gave him a lot of local support, but also rendered him many enemies. \nRodrigo, using the §GAmazonian Millitary Command§! that he founded himself as a peacekeeping force, projects his military power in the region, putting the rest of the locals at ease and appeasing the elites. However, as the war drags on and the Amazonian Military Command declines, Rodrigo started to crack under his own moral's weight and express desires to return to democracy. \nOnly god knows if these desires will ever become reality."
 FBO_LAMARCA_DESC:0 "No man in the Amazon can call himself as unlucky as Carlos Lamarca, no matter how much he’d tell you he knows what he’s doing. Born to a humble family of seven siblings in 1937, he lived most of his early life enduring the hardships of the favela, having taken an interest in political thought since he was 16. in 1955 he would go on to join the Brazilian Army Preparatory School of Cadets, only to be transferred to the Military Academy of Agulhas Negras two years later, where he graduated as an aspiring officer. When the civil war broke out in Brazil Lamarca originally fought for the Legalists and then deserting after the Paulista betrayal, with the war causing him to see the plight and suffering of those around him, he began reading socialist literature and educating himself on marxism. He would further radicalize when he met an old army friend of his who helped him join the springing leftist movements. When he heard of the Araguaia Guerrilla in 1964 through another one of his army leftists Onofre Pinto, he trekked to the North to join and then lead the guerrillas, thanks to his charisma amongst the troops. When the misfits rose up in Roraima, he was too busy fighting for the now failing Araguaia campaign. He was forced to leave there in May of 1966, where he would lead his own long march to the small riverside town of Fonte Boa, meeting much resistance, leading to the Periquito Massacre. His lack of knowledge about jungle living has brought disease, famine, and depression to his now ailing squad of revolutionaries. Now, suffering from all the conditions he blamed capitalism on, only a miracle can save him."
 RAONI_DESC:0 "Cacique Raoni Metuktire was born in the State of Mato Grosso in 1932, in the heart of the Brazilian part of the Amazon rainforest. Born in a nomadic tribe, his early life was marked by war and continuous travel with little to no contact with the outside world. In 1954 however, young Raoni's life would forever change, as the Villas-Bôas brothers introduced him to Western civilization, teaching him Portuguese and enlisting his help against the Amazon Rainforest industrialization efforts, eventually becoming a political activist.\nMore recently however, as guerrila partisan remnants of the Araguaia rebellion seek refuge in his territory en masse, and the military advances day by day seeking to renuite the country, the industrialization of the Amazon is the least of his concerns. Once again, Raoni finds himself and his tribe isolated, but learning from past mistakes. He swore not to let the white man conquer his people once more, and he is willing to fight to his last breath to avoid that."
