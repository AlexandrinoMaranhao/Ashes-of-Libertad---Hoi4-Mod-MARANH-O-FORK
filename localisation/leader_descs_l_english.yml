 ROR_ONOFRE_DESC:0 "Born in the south of the state of São Paulo, Onofre worked as a mechanic and accountant before joining the army, reaching the rank of sargent until his political rights were revoked by the Institutional Act n°1 in 1962, Onofre then joined the MNR, a guerrilla in the south of Brazil and the Araguaia Guerrilla after the breakup of the former. Along with Carlos Lamarca and many others Onofre took part in the migration north to the amazon fleeing from Araguaia after the Junta noticed their existence and ''dissolved'' the movement, leaving dead comrades and old ideals of libertarian Marxism behind as the reality of war scared his view of the world beyond recognition. He left for Boa Vista where his partnership with Wilson began and his carisma mixed with Onofre's military and guerrilla experience where able to turn the 12a Divisão de Infantaria do Norte (12° Northern Division of Infantry), the Misfits, against the Junta and convinced them to join the revolution."
 ROR_WILSON_DESC:0 "Born in 1933 in Amazonas, Wilson Souza de Pinheiro grew up in a poor, but happy family. During the 60s with the fall of rubber prices in Brazil him and his fellow rubber tappers found themselves employed and exploited by many rich land owners, and facing this situation, Wilson began advocating for worker's rights in Acre, where he worked at. After WW3 and the following civil war in Brazil, Wilson was contacted by Guevarist officials and told to hold an armed insurgency in the state of Acre; this revolt failed horribly, and faced with possible execution Souza fled north to Roraima and by chance met with Onofre Pinto and together made a new revolution, the Roraima Worker's Front. Upon his arrival, Wilson was quickly chosen as a their leader due to his rallying charisma and reputation. Now he must face the struggles of not only leading a country, but uniting the hungry populace and warry militants."
 COR_MONTORIL_DESC:0 "Born in the dry and misery-fertile lands of the Brazilian northeast, Montoril quickly fell in love with the wet and mysterious north when he moved there at an early age, his childhood however would not be an easy or happy one becoming an orphan and having to look after his brothers working as a black and goldsmith, police officer, dentist and finally enrolling in politics during the short lived tenentist levants of '32, when he became Military Mayor of Coari following the murder of it's former mayor, that however sparked his legendary career in Coarense politics and the Golden age of the city that, under his guidance, has managed to thrive for decades and emerge with prominence from the deep, dark jungle. As an old man in '61 he was elected again as mayor after a long hiatus from politics as if destiny itself put him in charge of his beloved little town once again in a time of desperation. During Coari's sacking on March 1st 1965 his reign almost came to a bloody end if not for the civilian mob that surrounded and protected him and his office during the chaos, a showcase of the people's gratitude and love for him. To anyone outside of the now desolate city this may seem... weird, but the undeniable only reason Coari still stands, even if only half alive, is the presence and guidance of this well dressed man."
 MNS_GILBERTO_MESTRINHO_DESC:0 "Gilberto Mestrinho de Medeiros Raposo was born in Manaus in February 1928, during his early life many considered him a smart guy with a bright future, due to his high grades in most classes and charm with the ladies. He grew up in a relatively safe enviroment, with a supporting wealthy family that gave him the best education money can buy. A ladies man, Gilberto never worried about getting a wife, nor having kids; he was a free spirit, going whenever the wind took him to, and the winds brought him much more then he could ever expect. \nDuring his first term as governor of Amazonas the world fell apart around him, it was the beggining of the end of Brazil's golden years but the rebirth of Manaus's, Mestrinho rallied together the rich and powerful of Manauan society to overthrow the government and AMC garrison stationed there, bringing Manaus's into a new golden age of prosperity under the guidance of it's oligarchical overlords. Life has not been kind to the "boto tucuxi" however, now stuck in his home city, surrounded by enemies, in a post-apocalyptical world with no family-members alive and ever fewer true allies. Despite all the downsides, the young man looks with a hopeful smile to the future, after all, the profit just keeps growing and growing."
 BEM_JARBAS_PASSARINHO_DESC:0 "Born in Xapuri, Acre, in January 11th 1920 to a small business owner and a housewife, Jarbas Passarinho never settled down. Moving to Porto Alegre in the south of the country when he was just 11 years old, and later to Rio de Janeiro to prepare for a military career, he never found himself a place to call his own. \nHe was an army officer when the Brazilian Armed Forces attempted a coup, which rendered him a lot of power and influence inside the junta, eventually joining the ARENA (National Renewal Alliance). Now, with Castelo Branco's appointment of Jarbas as the military governor of Pará, maybe he'll have a small chiefdom and perhaps, a home. If only his home wasn't on fire and under constant attacks from natives and guerrilas, that is."
 ACR_PROVISIONAL_DESC:0 "After the fall of Edgar Cerqueira's cabinet, and Che's attack on the young republic's borders, an emergency government was formed to secure stability and prosperity to the country. \n \nUnfortunately, ever since its inception, the provisional government has been in a gridlock, and not much progress has been made. Five years of political stalemate made the people question the true purpose of the republic, some even questioning if a republic is the best option..."
 NHA_RODRIGO_OTAVIO_DESC:0 "Born in Rio de Janeiro in 1910, Rodrigo Otávio Jordão Ramos now lives miles away from his home, deep in the Amazon's jungles, his memories of the City of God and the Bay of Guanabara interrupted by the sound of gunshots. He grew in the military scenario quickly, using his political connections and brilliant strategism, he eventually won the title General of the §GAmazonian Military Command§!. \n \nDespite being put there by the Junta, Rodrigo became disillusioned with them after their brutal crackdown on the §RAraguaia Guerrilla§!, turning his military branch into a neutral zone, balancing carefully between both the Republic and the Junta. \nThis neutrality gave him a lot of local support, but also rendered him many enemies. \nRodrigo, using the §GAmazonian Millitary Command§! that he founded himself as a peacekeeping force, projects his military power in the region, putting the rest of the locals at ease and appeasing the elites. However, as the war drags on and the Amazonian Military Command declines, Rodrigo started to crack under his own moral's weight and express desires to return to democracy. \nOnly god knows if these desires will ever become reality."
 FBO_LAMARCA_DESC:0 "No man in the Amazon can call himself as unlucky as Carlos Lamarca, no matter how much he’d tell you he knows what he’s doing. Born to a humble family of seven siblings in 1937, he lived most of his early life enduring the hardships of the favela, having taken an interest in political thought since he was 16. in 1955 he would go on to join the Brazilian Army Preparatory School of Cadets, only to be transferred to the Military Academy of Agulhas Negras two years later, where he graduated as an aspiring officer. When the civil war broke out in Brazil Lamarca originally fought for the Legalists and then deserting after the Paulista betrayal, with the war causing him to see the plight and suffering of those around him, he began reading socialist literature and educating himself on marxism. He would further radicalize when he met an old army friend of his who helped him join the springing leftist movements. When he heard of the Araguaia Guerrilla in 1964 through another one of his army leftists Onofre Pinto, he trekked to the North to join and then lead the guerrillas, thanks to his charisma amongst the troops. When the misfits rose up in Roraima, he was too busy fighting for the now failing Araguaia campaign. He was forced to leave there in May of 1966, where he would lead his own long march to the small riverside town of Fonte Boa, meeting much resistance, leading to the Periquito Massacre. His lack of knowledge about jungle living has brought disease, famine, and depression to his now ailing squad of revolutionaries. Now, suffering from all the conditions he blamed capitalism on, only a miracle can save him."
 RAONI_DESC:0 "Cacique Raoni Metuktire was born in the State of Mato Grosso in 1932, in the heart of the Brazilian part of the Amazon rainforest. Born in a nomadic tribe, his early life was marked by war and continuous travel with little to no contact with the outside world. In 1954 however, young Raoni's life would forever change, as the Villas-Bôas brothers introduced him to Western civilization, teaching him Portuguese and enlisting his help against the Amazon Rainforest industrialization efforts, eventually becoming a political activist.\nMore recently however, as guerrila partisan remnants of the Araguaia rebellion seek refuge in his territory en masse, and the military advances day by day seeking to reunite the country, the industrialization of the Amazon is the least of his concerns. Once again, Raoni finds himself and his tribe isolated, but learning from past mistakes. He swore not to let the white man conquer his people once more, and he is willing to fight to his last breath to avoid that."
 ADHEMAR_DESC:0 "Born in Piracicaba in 1901 to a traditional coffee planter family, Adhemar Pereira de Barros did many things in his life, from revolutionary in the 1932 Constitutionalist Revolution against the Vargas Regime to running for President twice in 1955 and 1960. On the height of the civil war, when the Legalits started with major victories on the Centereast front, the Southeastern Military Command, or the state of São Paulo, decided to align itself with the Republic in exchange for political and economic plans to benefit and grow the industrial heartland of the former nation into even greater glory after the conflict. But as the years went and the Gorillas gathered their potential strength, The oligarchs and high class families started to grow unruly, as their wealth drained with no profit in return. Adhemar de Barros was one of them, and went out of his way to secure and rise on the political scene, with little to none opposition, with many investigations for any type of fraudulency turning up empty-handed. Besides that, they were the only ones to repeatedly postpone the elections in the 4th Republic, with many conspiracists agreeing this was a planned setback to bring forth the Second Constitutionalist Revolution, with it brouthing São Paulo out of the Alliance and peacing out the Militarists."
 ARRAES_DESC:0 "Miguel Arraes’ rise to power was bumpy, but his future seems even bumpier. Born on December 15th of 1916 and descended from the revolutionary hero Bárbara de Alencar, he seemed destined to take part in the Sertão’s destiny. Arraes moved to Crato during his youth, where he saw first-hand many of the struggles of the common man in Brazil’s northeast. During the 30s, he was able to become a clerk for the Insitute of Sugar and Alchohol’s office in Recife, and shortly after that, he was able to acquire a law degree. In 1938, he became the assistant of the Director of Fiscalization, leaving that position to head the Recife Ministry himself and becoming a regional delegate in the ’40s. \nIn ‘48 he was appointed to the Ministry of Finance by then governor of Pernambuco, proving himself to be an unstoppable defender of the poor and the less favored, joining the Social Labor Party in ‘59, he was also mayor of Recife until 1962 when he was elected governor of Pernambuco 9 days before the end of the world. Enraged by the military coup and imprisoned in the isle of Fernando de Noronha for a year, he would help organize the liberal revolts against the Junta after escaping back to the mainland, hiding in a refugee ship from Europe heading to Natal. Following the wake of his victory against military control, he was the mind behind the birth of the Confederação Sertaneja, a tenuous political union of many northeastern states with varying levels of morality or loyalty.\nNow, his rule is heavily contested by bandit armies, socialist guerrillas, growing military disloyalty, and treacherous politicians from all sides of the political spectrum. Arraes however, remains loyal to what he believes most and will do whatever it takes to, in his words, “not betray the will of those who elected me”."
 ELIEZER_DESC:0 "A former civil engineer who studied in the University of Paraná, and formerly minister of mines and energy on President Goulart’s cabinet, Batista saw the bombs destroy not only the world but his seemingly bright future, once an internationally renowned engineer who revolutionized the way comerce was made he now leads the bedraggled remnants of the Sweet River Valley Mining Company, commanding a militia or mercenaries and volunteered workers, holding out on a northern corner of Minas Gerais against the ever-present menace of the Miner's Revolt, in his side is the full might of his company, or what is left of it."
 TEF_DJDL_DESC:0 "Joaquim de Lange is first and foremost, a humanist. Beginning his studies in the Netherlands as a Catholic, he studied Philosophy and Theology. After finishing his courses, he was in Angola throughout the period of the Second World War, and came to Brazil as a missionary for the Amazon after the war's end, being invoked to the desolate lands by the Catholic Church. Setting up post in the sleepy town of Tefé, Lange rose through the ranks and quickly became the most devout and most respected religious figure in Teré, having done proactive efforts in protecting the townsfolk and securing their basic needs. With pioneering efforts in bringing radio to Tefé, Lange has done more for his town than any central government in Rio de Janeiro. With this, it became very clear that after the bombs fell, the people of Tefé would befall into the loving bishop's authority, placing him as Mayor and Regent of the Municipality of Tefé, with help from the Quatro Povos das Missões. Now, dependent on the Missões' work and backing, Lange's independent shining city has all but lost its lustre."
 BAMBIRRA_DESC:0 "Silval manages his partisan army in an ever methodic, calculating fashion, as he did with all else in his life. He began his professional life as a textile worker, later assuming the presidency of the §RFederation of Weavers of Minas Gerais§!, a syndical union dedicated, as he was, to protect the rights of such laborers. His trajectory as a union leader came to an abrupt end when §rGeneral Olímpio Mourão Filho§! marched on the streets of Juiz de Fora and posteriorly Belo Horizonte, the state’s capital and residence of Bambirra, the occupation was brief but left deep marks on the most easy-to-catch prey such as the Federation’s HQ, that boasted a library - personally organized by Sinval Bambirra - composed of books donated by different Brazilian and foreign authors. \n\nDuring the occupation, many of these books, including a red-covered Bible donated by Pope John XXIII, were burned in the middle of the street, considered to be "subversive". This proved to be the final straw for the placid librarian. \nEscaping persecution Bambirra found refugee and purpose in the §RCOLINA§!, an organization of far-left armed guerrilla warfare that would come to steadily hold on to the heart of Minas Gerais, and that Bambirra would rapidly grow to the top, tending to it with great care as he did with his books before."
 ALUIZIO_DESC:0 "Brazil is not a tribal nation, at least not in its population centers. Yet, clans and families continued to keep their importance and influence even after the World ended. \nOf Potiguara stock, Aluízio Alves had some unremarkable posts in the Chamber of Deputies during the post-Vargas era, and by the time Brazil collapsed, his political family had managed to survive with most of its assets safe, their influence increasing even further as the rivalry with the Maia family became an evermore chaotic and bloody affair. Having suppressed his enemies, Alves managed to become evermore influential in the Sertaneja Confederation, staying close to its institutions even during its collapse, being one of the last states to break off. Yet, as the anarchy in the Confederation went on, he couldn't help but try and save the Potiguara people from falling to more chaos than they've already went through."
 LUSTOSA_DESC:0 "Antônio de Almeida Lustosa is a man from different times. Born in the very late years of the Brazilian Empire, he joined the Congregation of São Francisco de Sales in 1905 and maintained a deep relationship with religion since then. After a lengthy period of rising through the ranks of the Catholic Church, eventually Antônio became Archbishop of Fortaleza, and since then has been a deeply important authority figure in the city. A longtime artist of stained glass, his works in the Cathedral of Fortaleza are the magnum opus of his artistic life. And yet, it seemed like it all was about to come crashing down with the apocalypse - whilst he was spared and so was his beloved country, he was forced to spend much of his time helping refugees and keeping Brazil together. Pledging allegiance later on to the Sertaneja Confederation as Brazil collapsed, he once more switched allegiances with his own state of residence, using his influence and power in the area to keep the Ceará stable during the Confederation's collapse."
 ARANTES_DESC:0 "Born in the state of Goiânia, Aldo started his political activism in the high school student movement at the Liceu de Goiânia. He joined the Pontifical Catholic University in Rio de Janeiro to study law in 1959. He was a member of the Catholic University Youth before joining COLINA, acting immediately after the declaration of the military coup in '63.\nAffiliated with the Brazilian Communist Party before its fragmentation Aldo, along with his co-leader Bambirra, represent a deeply Christian and somewhat "traditional" strand of Brazilian communism, Arantes is an important figure who governs as a pillar the colloquially called "Revolt Mineira", orator of great capacity and destined for a political life that never happened, devoured by the guerrilla life in the Mineira hills."
 MARIGHELLA_DESC:0 "Who knows what the Devil is made of, or what depths he drags himself from when he comes to haunt our dreams. To the DOPS, DOI-COD, the Junta, and São Paulo’s Bourgeoisie, the Devil is a part Italian immigrant, part Malê rebel, and Hell isn’t hotter than Bahia. \nBor in 1911, §RMarighella§! had become literate early, at the age of four. His father encouraged Carlos to read national and imported books, especially French authors. Even renovating his office to serve Carlos as a study room. He enrolled in his first year in 1925 where he finished the course at the age of thirteen and moved to Ginásio da Bahia, where he became known for answering a physics test in verse, an exam so mindblowing it that was exposed at the school until the completion of the coup in ‘63, when his fame changed for the worse. \nIn 1934 he joined the §RPCB§!, then became a professional militant of the party and moved to Rio de Janeiro, working on the reorganization of the §RPCB§!. He was arrested multiple times from the Vargas era to the 1963 coup when he was shot and arrested by agents of the Department of Political and Social Order (DOPS) inside a movie theater in Rio without a police warrant. Released in 1965 by a court decision, something that would create a lot of regret in the following years. Living illegally, Marighella would become one of the heads of the §RBrazilian Communist Party§!, and after its fragmentation would become the founder of the §RAliança Renovadora Nacional§!, (§RALN§!), an urban guerrilla organization that terrorizes the nights of São Paulo. Marighella is the Nightmare of São Paulo, the architect of murders, bank robberies, and kidnappings against the elite of the city of drizzle. \n\n§RWHEN THE BOOGIEMAN IS ON THE STREETS KNOW TO FEAR THE NIGHT§!"
 PRESTES_DESC:0 "§RCarlos Prestes§! is perhaps the greatest figure of the Brazilian left-wing and one of the most influential men in 20th century Brazil, serving as a counterweight to Plínio Salgado's fascist right in the 1930s and leader of the greatest leftist coup attempt in the history of Brazil. nation, the uprising of the §RCommunist Intentona§! in 1935.\nIn 1931, he moved to the Soviet Union at the country's invitation, there, he worked as an engineer and devoted himself to Marxist-Leninist studies, adding to his past experiences in Bolivia, Argentina, and the Revolution of 1930, being elected member of the executive committee of the §RCommunist International§!. He returned as a clandestine to Brazil in December 1934, accompanied by the German Olga Benário. \n\nIn July 1935, Prestes issued a manifesto demanding "all power" for the §RANL§! and the overthrow of the Vargas government, however, the uprisings were easily quelled by the government, whose Political police, led by §rFilinto Müller§!, unleashed a violent process of repression, arrests, torture, and murders. Prestes was arrested, lost his position as captain, and began a nine-year prison sentence. His partner Olga Benário, even if pregnant, was arrested and later deported to her country of origin, even though she was Jewish. Her going to Germany was a death sentence. She was executed in the gas chamber in the §gRavensbrück Nazi§! concentration camp, her daughter would be rescued at the end of the war, born in the camp. In the Constituent Assembly of 1946, Prestes led the communist bench composed of figures such as §RJorge Amado§!, §RCarlos Marighella§!, §RJoão Amazonas§!, and the unionist §RClaudino Silva§!, all of which came to an end with the fragmentation of the Brazilian Communist Party that followed the coup of '63 and the subsequent disaster of the §RAraguaia Guerrilla§!. After that Prestes disappeared from the public eye, presumed dead or captured by the left, and a fugitive or self-exile by the right, and remained so for years while Brazil burned around him. \n\n§RUntil now§!."
 JULIAO_DESC:0 "Born in Engenho Boa Esperança, in rural and dry west of Pernambuco, Francisco was trained as a lawyer in 1939, in Recife, before being appointed leader in 1955 of an organization with the proclaimed objective of fighting for the distribution of land and rights for farmers, this movement became popular under the name "§RLigas Camponesas§!", or simply peasant leagues, which, in need of a spokesperson, summoned him. For fifteen years, Julião wandered through the cane fields of the Zona da Mata of Pernambuco, winning the confidence of the peasants as a lawyer, and most importantly, a helping hand in times of need. Facing the poverty of the people he had made a choice. He didn't want to defend the powerful. Transformed into the leader of the Peasant Leagues, Julião is considered a "saint" among the landless. In the eyes of those who fought them, he was called an agitator, an arsonist, a communist. Julião was grateful for the title of "agitator", saying that he always had been, "but within the law". After all, "you have to shake even a medicine before using it"…A Communist, according to him, he never was, but declares himself to be a socialist and a Marxist. In the chaos left by the power vacuum in Bahia, those who have not turned to crime, so fertile in cangaço, turn to Julião as if in search of a lighthouse, and Julião is forced to accept that the titles placed on him may have to come true if the Leagues, and himself, want to have a future, becoming the general of a shoeless, landless, homeless army."
 ARNON_DESC:0 "Working as a journalist by trade, Arnon had lost his job when the 1930 revolution occured, giving him a hatred of sorts for populist types for the rest of his life. A deep conservative, as soon as the Estado Novo period had ended, he entered politics as part of the UDN. Hailing from Alagoas, a small state in the Sertão, Arnon's peak in politics came from a period since 1950 where he and Silvestre Péricles had fought over the post of Governor. With the Apocalypse, Arnon's life changed very little, the old rivalries actually coming to a boiling point during some squabbles in '62, creating a footnote in Brazil's chaotic final years: Péricles, his lifelong enemy, had begun to raise a gun to murder Arnon, and yet at the last moment Arnon managed to shoot first, accidentally killing a different deputy. Whilst the case has been solved, the profound scars in Arnon's life has made him a hateful man, whose conservatism has only endeepend with his unwavering support for ARENA and the wider military dictatorship, causing him some political fallout, and yet he stands above his enemies all the same."
 GONDIM_DESC:0 "A founder of the Social Democrat Party, one of the giants of 1940s Brazil, Gondim has been a lifelong defender of democracy, and yet he saw it burn, only to shrug all the same. Collaborating with the ARENA military dictatorship, he created a confusing agenda for Paraíba, undoing an ungodly amount of oligarchic dominance over the state - yet not enough to be counted as a socialist in any capacity, or for that matter, enough to anger the military men - who had already been dealing with huge numbers of problems. By the time that the military dictatorship retreated into the interior, he continued his fame as a turncoat and sided with the Sertaneja Confederation. Yet, those that call him a turncoat, a traitor to Democracy, forget: He only sides with the people of Paraíba, and not anything else."
 SEIXAS_DORIA_DESC:0 "It's kind of humorous how the UDN combined all sorts of people. Seixas Dória does not find this as humorous. Most of his early life being a total mystery, he only became politically relevant after the Vargas Era, where he represented Aracaju as its mayor from the mid 40s. Eventually in the 60s, he joined the UDN, which comprised of a broad front of defenders - and dismantlers - of Democracy. Being on the former sector, Seixas Dória was absolutely miffed to the thought of Brazil falling to military dictatorship, and yet could do little about it as a single man. However, the Apocalypse would come calling, and his life became a lot more interesting since then. As Brazilian authority collapsed slowly but surely, Dória sided with the Sertaneja Confederation and became the Governor of Sergipe. Breaking off from the chaotic state after its collapse, he now leads Sergipe as a conservative democrat, an increasingly rare type of politician in a world of oddities and ecletic despots."
