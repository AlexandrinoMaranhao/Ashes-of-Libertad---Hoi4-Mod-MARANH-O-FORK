 ROR_ONOFRE_DESC:0 "Born in the south of the state of São Paulo, Onofre worked as a mechanic and accountant before joining the army, reaching the rank of sargent until his political rights were revoked by the Institutional Act n°1 in 1962, Onofre then joined the MNR, a guerrilla in the south of Brazil and the Araguaia Guerrilla after the breakup of the former. Along with Carlos Lamarca and many others Onofre took part in the migration north to the amazon fleeing from Araguaia after the Junta noticed their existence and ''dissolved'' the movement, leaving dead comrades and old ideals of libertarian Marxism behind as the reality of war scared his view of the world beyond recognition. His stay at Fonte Boa was brief, he shortly left for Boa Vista where his partnership with Wilson began and his carisma mixed with Onofre's military and guerrilla experience where able to turn the 12a Divisão de Infantaria do Norte (12° Northern Division of Infantry), the Misfits, against the Junta and convinced them to join the revolution."
 ROR_WILSON_DESC:0 "Born in 1933 in Amazonas, Wilson Souza de Pinheiro grew up in a poor, but happy family. During the 60s with the fall of rubber prices in Brazil him and his fellow rubber tappers found themselves employed and exploited by many rich land owners, and facing this situation, Wilson began advocating for worker's rights in Acre, where he worked at. After WW3 and the following civil war in Brazil, Wilson was contacted by Guevarist officials and told to hold an armed insurgency in the state of Acre; this revolt failed horribly, and faced with possible execution Souza fled north to Roraima and by chance met with Onofre Pinto and together made a new revolution, the Roraima Worker's Front. Upon his arrival, Wilson was quickly chosen as a their leader due to his rallying charisma and reputation. Now he must face the struggles of not only leading a country, but uniting the hungry populace and warry militants."
 COR_MONTORIL_DESC:0 "Born in the dry and misery-fertile lands of the Brazilian northeast, Montoril quickly fell in love with the wet and mysterious north when he moved there at an early age, his childhood however would not be an easy or happy one becoming an orphan and having to look after his brothers working as a black and goldsmith, police officer, dentist and finally enrolling in politics during the short lived tenentist levants of '32, when he became Military Mayor of Coari following the murder of it's former mayor, that however sparked his legendary career in Coarense politics and the Golden age of the city that, under his guidance, has managed to thrive for decades and emerge with prominence from the deep, dark jungle. As an old man in '61 he was elected again as mayor after a long hiatus from politics as if destiny itself put him in charge of his beloved little town once again in a time of desperation. During Coari's sacking on March 1st 1965 his reign almost came to a bloody end if not for the civilian mob that surrounded and protected him and his office during the chaos, a showcase of the people's gratitude and love for him. To anyone outside of the now desolate city this may seems... weird, but the undeniable only reason Coari still stands, even if only half alive, is the presence and guidance of this well dressed man."
 MNS_GILBERTO_MESTRINHO_DESC:0 "Gilberto Mestrinho de Medeiros Raposo was born in Manaus in February 1928, during his early life many considered him a smart guy with a bright future, due to his high grades in most classes and charm with the ladies. He grew up in a relatively safe enviroment, with a supporting wealthy family that gave him the best education money can buy. A ladies man, Gilberto never worried about getting a wife, nor having kids; he was a free spirit, going whenever the wind took him to, and the winds brought him much more then he could ever expect. \nDuring his first term as governor of Amazonas the world fell apart around him, it was the beggining of the end of Brazil's golden years but the rebirth of Manaus's, Mestrinho rallied together the rich and powerful of Manauan society to overthrow the government and AMC garrison stationed there, bringing Manaus's into a new golden age of prosperity under the guidance of it's oligarchical overlords. Life has not been kind to the "boto tucuxi" however, now stuck in his home city, surrounded by enemies, in a post-apocalyptical world with no family-members alive and ever fewer true allies.

 BEM_JARBAS_PASSARINHO_DESC:0 "Born in Xapuri, Acre, January 11th, 1920, to a small business owner and a housewife, Jarbas Passarinho never settled down. Moving to Porto Alegre in the south of the country when he was just 11 years old, and later to Rio de Janeiro to prepare for a military career, he never found himself a place to call his own. \nHe was an army officer when the Brazilian Armed Forces attempted a coup, which rendered him a lot of power and influence inside the junta, eventually joining the ARENA (National Renewal Alliance). Now, with Castelo Branco's appoitment of Jarbas as the military governor of Pará, maybe he'll have a small chiefdom and perhaps, a home.
