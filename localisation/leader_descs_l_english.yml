As an old man in '61 he was elected again as mayor after a long hiatus from politics as if destiny itself put him in charge of his beloved little town once again in a time of desperation. During Coari's sacking on March 1st 1965 his reign almost came to a bloody end if not for the civilian mob that surrounded and protected him and his office during the chaos, a showcase of the people's gratitude and love for him.
