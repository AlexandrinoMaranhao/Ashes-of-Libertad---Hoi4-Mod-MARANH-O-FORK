 ACR_intro_final_desc:0 "Regardless of where you stand, as a tapper, as a politician or as a militia fighter one thing is certain for you, your future and that of the republic is uncertain at best..."
 ACR_the_1967_constitution_desc:0 "In 1963 after the republic’s founding it was decided that a constitution must be written, not by one man or a group, but by the people, now after 5 years that can finally be done."
 ACR_minorities_no_desc:0 "The discussion about the native case is over, it was decided that the best option for coexistence with them is separation, some of these voices seem honest about their decision, some appear to be based on petty racism, regardless, the vote is now over."
 ACR_minorities_yes_desc:0 "The discussion about the native case is over, it was decided that the best option for coexistence with them is integration, some of these voices seem honest about their decision, some appear to be based on ‘’the white man’s burden’’ way of thinking, regardless, the vote is now over."
 ACR_press_no_desc:0 "The discussion about the press’s case is over, it was decided that the best option is controlling the press and keeping it free of dangerous thoughts to the Republic."

 ACR_workers_no_desc:0 "The discussion about the worker’s cause is over, it was decided that worker’s rights come first, even if to the detriment of the Republic’s production rate."
 ACR_workers_yes_desc:0 "The discussion about the worker’s cause is over, it was decided that the republic’s economic needs come first, especially in these troubling times."
 ACR_the_red_menace_desc:0 "To the south lies our greatest and oldest enemy, Bolivia, corrupted and controlled by an army of bloodthirsty revolutionaries always plotting, planning, regrouping and slowly getting ready to attack our young republic once again, we must be ready for when that day comes."
 ACR_defend_in_the_cities_desc:0 "When Che Guevara first attacked years before our most astonishing victory came in the city of Brasiléia, it has become clear that Che has little experience in an urban environment, we shall use this to our advantage."
 ACR_defend_in_the_jungle_desc:0 "Acre is a place of thick and dense jungle with few civilized places, although Che Guevara’s men are used to fighting in such terrain it is also the perfect place to wage a defensive war."
 ACR_conscription_law_desc:0 "What we call a defense force is constituted of a series of independent militias that operate autonomously, that often leads to problems like infighting between militias and abuse of power, they are however all united under the goal of protecting Acre’s people, and therefore will listen to the government once we take action to control then, the question is, how will we do this. "
 ACR_general_of_the_people_desc:0 "The time has come to elect an all powerful leader of our armed forces, after much discussion between the parties the senate chose Jorge Kalume, former leader of the ‘’Beirut Militia’’ and popular hero from Che’s skirmish as our General."
 ACR_general_of_the_army_desc:0 "The time has come to elect an all powerful leader of our armed forces, after much discussion between the parties the senate chose Edgar Cerqueira, candidate to the presidency, ex-governor of Acre and former leader of the 14th Frontier Battalion from before Acre’s independence as our General."
 ACR_involvement_of_the_army_in_politics_desc:0 "The Militaristic party has fomented a most unusual discussion in the senate, they argue that members of the armed forces should have extra power when discussing politics, or even have exclusive rights within the senate emulating ancient Rome’s senatorial system, although some find this to be ridiculous the vote was called anyway, and the results were..."
 ACR_the_senate_desc:0 "The Senate of Rio Branco is an effort to bring the distant and dispersed voices of the communities of Acre together under a single roof, so that they can, together, decide Acre’s road forward, it has proven to be a massive headache so far but after many years of preparation progress has finally began..."
 ACR_appoint_senator_1_desc:0 "Naturally the senators began to group together with like minded folk inside the voting chamber, slowly creating Acre’s first political parties, amongst those senators one voice spoke louder than others, that of Hélio Cury."

 ACR_appoint_senator_3_desc:0 "Naturally the senators began to group together with like minded folk inside the voting chamber, slowly creating Acre’s first political parties, amongst those senators one voice spoke louder than others, that of Marques de Souza."
 ACR_economy_law_desc:0 "The commerce of Latex and rubber, the so-called Black Gold, is what gives life to Acre and it’s people. Therefore it is important that our direction moving forward is decided as early as possible and is made clear to all people who may care."
 ACR_censorship_desc:0 "The Senate is assembled to further discuss the matter of the militias and police force, how they should operate and treat the citizens."

 ACR_power_of_the_senate_desc:0 "How powerful should the Senate be, a question that keeps generating discussion in the Rio Branco Palace day after day, some argue that the president should be able to overrule it, some wish to copy the US or even the British Parliamentary system, in the end it was decided that..."
 ACR_right_of_vote_desc:0 "The Right to Vote was once a privilege, in a liberal democracy such as this it is expected that all members of the republic should be able to vote, however, there are some that wish to go back to traditional ways, with more limitations."
 ACR_no_rest_for_the_sick_desc:0 "The Militaristic party keeps adding complaints to the pile, today’s was they have pushed a little too far with their request, that of the declaration of ‘’state of siege’’ claiming the threat of Che Guevarra’s army should bring immediate army reforms, total mobilisation and emergency draft. Some claim however that such drastic measures so early in the Republic’s lifetime could prove catastrophic."
 ACR_finish_the_constitution_desc:0 "All decisions made, all senators present, all parties assembled together under one roof, today is the great day when Acre will become a true country, founded by principles set in paper but made of steel, and now, finally, the Senate can come together once more and vote for the Acre’s Republic first President."

# Cury
#####################
ACR_cury_presidency_desc:0 "The results are in, and with double confirmation, Hélio Cury is now the new president of the Acrean Republic. Many citizens are celebrating on the streets, calling a new age for democracy. It is our duty to keep our promises right, so don’t lose your head."
ACR_regulate_expansion_rubber_plantations_desc:0 "As his first reform in office, Hélio now begins and brings to the senate floor a program, with the intention of regulating the current unregulated tapper industry, conserving it to survive for future generations. Many senators are unsure to think of this, and he knows that. His plan is to diplomatically and democratically make a compromise with the help of his voters and public support, and then pass his adjustments."
ACR_compromise_with_technocrats_desc:0 "Two sides of the same coin: If we were to compromise with the Technocrats to pass the conservation laws, they will ask for some favors in return. It could be more professionals assuming leadership or more control in the bureaucracy in Acre. But this also means they wouldn't like severely monetizing it for profit. This is critical, so if we are going this path, we must be aware of the consequences."
ACR_end_correrias_desc:0 "Correrias, to simply put, are the action of a pre-emptive attack on natives communities in order to use their land for whatever the intention of the invasion is. Like clearing the area for rubber plantation, using the trees for loggers or gold mining. Putting an end to it is nothing but a service to humanity."
ACR_compromise_with_militarists_desc:0 "Two sides of the same coin: The militarists are always an open option, and if we want them on our side, they will want more control over the nation. They would want more seats in the senate, more money spent on the industrial capacity of acre plus the army, and of course a plan against the ERN. Although they will oblige to the terms of conservation of the rubber industry and our plan to monetize that, their requests are in our terms a bit aggressive, so thinking wise before signing this contract."
ACR_intervene_seringalist_rallies_desc:0 "We saw this coming and we are resolving it just now, unironically. Tapper workers and industrialists are rallying at all sides from the republic calling for the repeal of correrias. The outrage and stress from this can be seen on our cabinets growing distress. We surely will find a way to make concessions out of this, just need time."
ACR_compromise_with_tappers_desc:0 "Ok, we finally found an accord with the Tappers. We will let them stay in any occupied area by ongoing Correrias and expand on it but never go ever to a designated area that is specifically for native tribes. We wished we could agree to better terms for the natives' interests, but that’s the only way they would accept, and hopefully everything should calm down now."
ACR_buying_votes_senate_desc:0 "After all the Correrias controversy, the Senate is divided. They won't allow us to pass more reforms that they now call “Extremists”. The only way we see to overcome this is by buying their votes for favors or whatever they need or want. This wasn’t the way we planned on going, but we need to regain their loyalty for our plans to move forward again."
ACR_creation_native_reserves_desc:0 "All the paperwork has been signed, and it's now official: The native people can now rest easy knowing that the government has assigned special zones to live and thrive while being protected by law against Tappers. While not in their ancestors homeland, these reserves will protect them enough from most tappers."
ACR_create_native_militias_desc:0 "While being safeguarded by the republic is good, There is still the big threat of Lawbreakers thinking they are too smart for their own greed. To counteract this, we are allowing the natives to arm themselves to defend immediately when an invasion occurs. This cost should give the Indians enough independence so they don’t have to always rely on us."
ACR_natives_in_army_desc:0 "The militarists have given us news that the Native Voluntary Divisions has finally completed their training! We now have an native army that has no trouble dealing with the deeps of the jungle in the amazon. It should give us an advantage if Che ever decides to attack us and contact other tribes in the region."
ACR_pass_native_defence_act_desc:0 "And with the senate’s trust, we made another breakthrough. The Native Defense Act gives the Natives the same citizenship as all Acreans in the republic, and considers any crimes against them as highly offensive with life sentences. And thus, another win in our books."
ACR_give_them_voice_desc:0 "We have given the natives protection, rights and now a place in our politics. A pure blooded native will now be a senator, having the same power as all others. Plus, there will be a new Newspaper specially made for them, while the name is still subject to change, many agree to call it “O Guarani”."
ACR_found_funai_desc:0 "The Fundação Nacional de Inteligência is now operational and on stand-by. The FUNAI, for short, is an intelligence agency that uses volunteer native workforce in missions of diplomacy with all other native tribes in the amazon rainforest. They are not limited to deep jungle infiltration and guerrilla, rudimentary spy work and jungle warfare, and mixing classic native american knowledge about the jungle with good old white western warfare."
ACR_railroad_to_heaven_desc:0 "The new mechanization endeavors are starting to become real. Our engineers have shown the possibility of a railroad connecting us to all of brazil again through the Madeira-Mamoré railroad. Truly amazing and creative ideia, yes. And of course, there is a “but” to all of it..."
ACR_passing_through_hell_desc:0 "...Which is the big elephant in the room: That railroad is owned by Che Guevarra from the ERN. So if we are going to use it, we need to plan for war. The engineers have laid out the schematics of a giant War Train to break through their guerrillas, which now requested for funding. May god protect us from this evil."
ACR_bringing_electricity_to_acre_desc:0 "Using the rich rive system of Acre it's possible to make damns and gather electricity from them, even if rudimentary so, that way electricity can be brought to event the farthest places of the country."
ACR_defend_acre_little_princess_desc:0 "Xapuri is no ordinary town, but the only hub of local trades that in turn trades with Rio Branco to then be barter back on the amazonian marketplace. So in summary, if Xapuri is ever raided, the small owner business properties that can’t afford to sell on further away markets wont move their goods to the Rio Branco market, so it would slow to a crawl, which could make our economy collapse for lack of goods. It is important to have the military nearby in case anything happens."
ACR_xapuri_acre_pride_desc:0 "Why just rubber? Why limit ourselves? We sell rubber, sell nuts as well! As part of diversifying the economy, so we don’t have to rely on one single resource, we are highly encouraging the plantation of Pará-nuts in Xapuri so our production becomes more independent besides rubber."
ACR_revise_sni_actions_acre_desc:0 "The SNI is acting on it’s on. Sometimes it does things that we never ordered them to do and other times they do the complete opposite, ordering them and not filling it. Although many call for a reshuffle or the complete disband of the cabinet, we decided to do some revisions that may do the trick. We’ll see what were our mistakes and what needs to be punished with reason."
ACR_dream_big_desc:0 "Although acre wasn’t a wide state like Pará or Amazonas, we could become a tall, developed nation if we use all our territory to its fullest potential. But Acre alone isn't enough, luckly for us the Upper Amazon is still in a state of Anarchy and plans for annexing it can, and will, be drafted and readied."
ACR_acre_fortune_for_acre_alone_desc:0 "Getting rich baby."
ACR_meeting_our_neighbours_desc:0 "Placeholder event triggers to Coari, the QPM and Manaus."
ACR_establish_relations_with_manaus_desc:0 "Self Explanatory."
ACR_create_fluvial_defense_fleet_desc:0 "A fluvial navy is hastedly assembled to combat Coari's asshole behavior."
ACR_close_doors_desc:0 "In an effort to protect Rio Branco from Coari the Purus river is essentially closed off by annexing the settlement of Boca do Acre, fittingly named "Acre's Mouth.""
ACR_manaus_rio_branco_pact_desc:0 "Mutual assistence to maintain their newly founded independence."
ACR_buy_guns_from_manaus_desc:0 "They buy guns from Manaus."

#   Marques  #   
##############
ACR_marques_presidency_desc:0 "Marques de Souza, champion of workers's rights and leader of the Technocratic faction, has triumphed. Having been narrowly elected President of the Acrean Republic, the new leader has been lauded by rubber tappers and impoverished as much as he is demonized by corporations and businessmen. All now wait eagerly for the firebrand's first actions in office."
ACR_worker_cause_desc:0 "Without workers, a nation is nothing. So why do laborers continue to suffer under trinket wages, horrible conditions, and brutal treatment? Why do their corporate overlords treat them as if they were slaves of antiquity? President de Souza will waste no time. He will take the battle for the worker to the Senate."
ACR_compromise_with_nationalists_desc:0 "Perhaps we judged the Nationalists too harshly. While they are certainly not perfect, we can agree with them on many counts. Their fight for the legal equality of natives, for instance, is admirable. We will throw them a bone and offer to pass some legislation in accordance with their platform - if they'd do the same with ours."
ACR_compromise_with_militarists_two_desc:0 "The Militarists are our enemy. Their leaders are openly hostile towards our fairly elected government, and rumors of a planned coup are even surfacing. Yet, we also need their votes in order to pass our reforms. A deal with the devil will be offered. We will support those of their initiatives which are not entirely disagreeable, should they vote for ours."
ACR_promise_to_limit_reforms_desc:0 "Our radical promises and changes to labor policy and rights has alarmed even some moderates within our faction. Now that we have struck a compromise with our political opponents, we will publicly dial back the reforms and begin acting on our promises, all in the name of ensuring their votes."
ACR_haha_sike_desc:0 "...or not. While we need to keep up a facade of moderation in public, piecemeal reform and limited change will not suffice here. To keep our opponents in the dark about our true policies, we will control the press and flow of information through censorship, replacing coverage of our legislation with entertainment such as TV shows and plays."
ACR_revise_worker_rights_desc:0 "Sometimes you need to crack a few eggs in order to make an omelette. We are doing some behind the scenes reforms focusing on our rubber fields, but some people just don’t see our way of thinking and as a result, we are “pulling apart” their plantations. We are still going to plan forward on how to get them together again, but for now we’ll continue with our goals as per usual."
ACR_medicare_for_all_desc:0 "Medicare for All"
ACR_placido_castro_hospital_desc:0 "Great to amazing news for all people of Acre! Our new and modern hospital in Rio Branco has finally been inaugurated! With this in mind, we can finally attend more patients at a time plus faster and shorter recoveries! Truly a time that all of us will be alive for!"
ACR_jungle_hospitals_desc:0 "To think that we would limit ourselves to a centered budget concentrating in Rio Branco is worrying, since this money could be used for building minor hospitals around the rural, remote areas plus regional trade centers of Acre that could make a difference for low class workers. The senate has decided to do just that, and approved the accountentes with the money to do it."
ACR_education_for_common_man_desc:0 "A man should not be denied the basic right to education, no matter their age, social status or if they are a worker or a businessman. It is important for the next generations that they become educated and ready for the changes of the world, for the future lies with them."
ACR_generic_education_desc:0 "We all think that the books that our children get should be the ones that are the best, so they can develop critical thinking and skills that can be used later down in life. If otherwise, our system that they will inherit could collapse from inexperience."
ACR_selected_books_desc:0 "Let’s be honest, children must be guided by their parents, or else they would get lost in a world of supposed “free choice”. We can’t let them choose another philosophy different than ours, that would mean our demise. So that’s why we are going to raise them with books made especially for them, so we can secure our future."
ACR_make_changes_last_desc:0 "The brain drain that the civil war brought upon us is finally starting to improve, slowly but surely. The graduates from our universities now publicly debate with the people, like the farmers and tappers, to the many philosophical questions that our nation has now. It sparked a tiny intellectual elite that daily speak about such things, in general, the population is now smarter and conscious about their lives. Could we be the next big players in the new world?"
ACR_battle_manaus_monopoly_desc:0 "Manaus is running on a exploited system. They don’t care about the worker, the common man. They only care about their aristocrat elite and filling their pockets full of the low class hard earnings. and they don’t see that reality, they just accept it. It’s sickly just thinking about it. Down with the ruling class of Manaus and their government!"
ACR_starve_them_out_desc:0 "We know how to cut the throat of this pig. We’ll close our rubber trades for them and watch them bleed without their precious resource. We will suffer a bit but our nation is bound to work around that. If they can survive the aftermath, and endure the pain that will cause, they will be weak to crush and destroy."
ACR_make_manaus_beg_desc:0 "While war has not been declared, we need to make something. So we shall suffocate Manaus with a embargo until they cave in to our demands. Should they neglect our offers, a military action by either side will be eminent."
ACR_capitalism_for_communism_sake_desc:0 "The Rubber trade has progressively going forward at a steady rate, to the point we can divert a vast majority of it’s growing welfare to social programs for workers and public arts, as an example. Many think of a backup plan when the profit eventually windles, and we will do that, but for now we keep it up as long as we can."
ACR_desperate_negotiations_desc:0 "Time has been going fast since Che Guevara attacked us. All of our government cabinets have been in high tension since then. Sure we stopped his offensive, but everyone believes he will do it for a second time. We directed all of our nation’s resources into contacting Che, and hopefully we can sort everything out."
ACR_flirt_with_communists_desc:0 "Che Guevara lies just bellow us in Bolivia with his army, and they may prove themselves useful for our national interests. We shall send signals of cooperation and begin talks with the congress about an alliance with the Revolutionary Army. If everything goes right, the future of their army and our nation will be secured."
ACR_write_cute_letter_desc:0 "Write a Cute Letter"
ACR_order_patrols_to_halt_desc:0 "Order Patrols to Halt"
ACR_red_flags_in_border_desc:0 "With Che evermore close to us, we can finally start putting up flags that, unknown to the public, are sympathetic to their cause. It’s a test, to make known to the guerrillas that we are not the enemy, but instead, a valuable ally. We are opening it up near the rivers, roads near the border, and even on town centers of border towns."
ACR_hotline_guevara_desc:0 "After our first signs of cooperation have been successful, we have decided to install a telephone line directly with Che Guevara, approaching even more our nations and ensuring that so no incidents may happen between our troops and their soldiers. Even if a further alliance fail, this phone line will make sure that both nations are safe."
ACR_show_our_intentions_desc:0 "We’ve finally done it. Channels with the ERN and Che Guevarra himself are now open for us. This must be kept top secret and only to be acknowledged by a selective few, since if it gets out, the militarists and the public will surely riot. Now, may our talks begin."
ACR_combined_efforts_desc:0 "As our nations continue cooperating, Marques has proposed that the Acrean army and the Revolutionary force make joint military exercises and economic aid, a idea that many will vote against, but with the right incentives, the deal will be passed, and our nations shall make further cooperation."
ACR_talk_business_desc:0 "Now that we have finally proven to be noteworthy for the ERN, they are slowly opening up for us. But in order to be considered loyal to them for future cooperation, we need to do some tasks that it presents to us. These kinds of “favors” could range for a variety of things that we don’t have knowledge of, but should we continue being friends with Che, they are a necessity."
ACR_keep_relationship_professional_desc:0 "Now that our efforts have payed off, we have finally been rewarded. Substantial military help is coming from the south and is coming fast. Che has sent us manpower and guns to help in the defense of the republic, and now we are ready for any kind of threat. We are not afraid to shoot strangers anymore!"
ACR_holding_hands_with_che_desc:0 "As part of our continues effort of maintaining good relations, Che has said on radio that he will send one of his most trusted advisors to be his representative for future agreements. Great news, since this will mean faster and greater opportunities for collaboration with them. meanwhile, as always, being the ones benefiting on the end of the bargain."
ACR_ask_for_a_kiss_desc:0 "We have reached a point that we could now ask for more closer or personal with our relationship with Marques and Che, with that being to establish trade and trade routes with the ERN. We will convince and request permission with his advisor and wait for a response by the other party."
ACR_ask_for_permission_to_go_deeper_desc:0 "Now with the trade routes established, we will petition something riskier, which is the access to the ERN rivers and the Madre de Dios river system for further trading opportunities. Our nation debates heavily on their response, some clamming that would be already asking for too much. However, to further our goals and survival, this must go through."
ACR_mutual_love_for_working_class_desc:0 "Oh my, what a wonderful time are we living in. The ERN and Acre’s relations are better than ever! We are trading valuable resources between both parties and our worries about them attacking us are basically none! Even the quality of life in our nation has improved, although nobody knows why, and hopefully they all accept that. Marques says that he’s making something really special for this occasion for Che, and he is dedicated to it. Some say that it might be a play or a poem, considering his background."
ACR_keep_relationship_secret_desc:0 "Make the Relationship Public"
ACR_deal_with_parents_against_it_desc:0 "Since the day where we publicly announce our partnership with the ERN our biggest opposition is Cerqueira and his militarists. There will be a meeting with all the senators to discuss further negotiations with Che in which we can hopefully deal and convince the senate to join our side for the Acrean people."
ACR_promises_of_independence_desc:0 "With all the chaos reaching all the sides of the republic, we’ve finally talked on radio and ended this issue diplomatically. We have settled on a treaty with the ARC as a white peace. This will surely keep Che happy, and we finally get them off our tail after all these years, but the Militarists are mad for not resolving the issue indefinitely and some senators protest for losing valuable land and people to the ERN. Nevertheless, with the time we have now, we can deal with all these affairs calmly."
ACR_make_love_not_war_desc:0 "With our independence secured the citizens of Acre can finally relax, knowing that the red devil has hidden his fangs. President Marques however can do one better, give in to the rummors of collaborationism and officially declare Acre as a nation aligned with Che's ideals. This would be highly controversial at least, catastrophic at best, but the option to present this to the senate stands."

# Cerqueira #   
#############
ACR_cerqueria_presidency_desc:0 "The ballots are counted and, to everyone's shock, Cerqueira got the majority of the votes. Now in charge of his second term in office, he’s prepared to take action on major changes to the state."
ACR_sideline_tappers_desc:0 "With Cerqueira on the stage discussions on the senate floor about the rubber camps, industry and third party sellers, basically anything related to rubber, have halted. Many intellectuals of the nation believe that the president did this so he could silence major rubber producers, and now rumors rooms the nation of nationalization of all industries. What is he planning to do next?"
ACR_arrest_communist_sympathisers_desc:0 "Honesty is a virtue and virtues are something the socialists lack. We can’t let these “people” free or worse, politically active. There is going to be intense backlash from the Technocrats, since it is where they are the most concentrated, so we need to be quick to silence them before letting the word out."
ACR_arrest_marques_for_reason_desc:0 "Oh Marques, the little commie in our wonderful and democratic republic. We all know he’s leaking to the ERN, and if we want to remain in control, we need to take him out of the picture. A night raid will be conducted on his current location and from there, we'll arrest him for siding with the commies. No word should come out of this, we'll put him in somewhere where nobody will ever find."
ACR_forge_charges_against_nationalists_desc:0 "Another big problem are the Acrean nationalists. In order to press our future plans forward, we must condemn this early threat while it is still weak. We will blackmail these senators inside the senate with made up nonsense or personal tastes, threatening to reveal leaks to the press otherwise. And if not, we will arrest them so we can finally get them out of our way."
ACR_assassinate_helio_cury_desc:0 "I never really liked Cury, to be honest. He is just too naive to understand our motives, and his grasp on the Nationalists is just to big to let him live. That’s why we must coordinate a assassination for him. Kidnap him unexpectedly and take him to our dungeon, interview for info and after, kill him."
ACR_bosque_correctional_facility_desc:0 "With the facility finally being completed, we can finally put in it the enemies and antagonists of the people or anyone who tries to go against our rule. And with it’s minimal exposure and far off Rio Branco, we can relax that these criminals are distant from the political center of our nation, as they can’t ever escape to try and overthrow us."
ACR_hostile_takeover_of_rubber_trade_desc:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures. We cannot relay in the same system that lead to the fall of civilization, which leaves us with no other option then nationalize every single private property in the state, there will be resistance, but that is when the army comes to play. The ones that do not agree with our terms will be shot and disposed. We must be the lion in the cat versus mouse game."
ACR_all_money_to_military_desc:0 "Do people know what happened in the world? Do they know what horrors the reds brought upon the US, Cuba or Brazil? And can we all agree that they will come for us next? That’s why Cerqueira decided to put almost all of our budget into the army, so we can prevent and rise upon the ashes as the people who survived the world burning, and set off as a new and independent empire."
ACR_prove_our_worth_desc:0 "We don’t need any help, and we will prove it. We may be undersupplied, underequiped and inexperienced but we will take this fight head-on with the abomination that is the ERN. We'll prove to the Junta and ERN alike that Acre isn't just some piece of land made only so it can be forgotten. Lord have mercy on us."
ACR_depend_on_greater_state_desc:0 "The Facts are on the table, and we cannot deny its existence: The ERN is military superior to us. If we want to take this snake head-on, it would require help from a third party, the Brazilian Military Junta. Some say this would be a mistake, aligning to Junta and putting us in their sphere of influence, but they are also enemies of the state, so why we should care?"
ACR_force_discipline_in_militias_desc:0 "In order to advance and prepare our military for greater conflicts that may happen sooner or later, we are going to entirely rewrite it into a proper and skilled army. We are taking as reference the traditional Brazilian military structure that will pack a punch harder than any militia could ever dream. We have seen it working on the field with great results, and surely will help us tremendously in our future wars."
ACR_emergency_army_reforms_desc:0 "With all intents and purposes, war is soon inevitable, and we are going to win that, we all agree that we need more major changes to our corps. The army needs to be reeducated with higher knowledge of the battlefield that may turn the tides, and with it, everyone will be benefited by this: the senators, the people and Cerqueira."
ACR_renew_officer_staff_desc:0 "Cerqueira just announced the complete renewed generals that came from the coast, substituting our current ones with Brazilian officers. This is good news, since the current directors were inexperienced in the art of warfare, sure, but many people in our nation can’t give in to the fact that they might still be good to keep around."
ACR_makeshift_army_desc:0 "To say we need the Junta is an understatement; we NEED to become the Junta. If our selves want to mean anything to them, we need to make their military staff, their way of governing and thinking identical to ours. Cerqueira is rolling out major reforms with all of it in mind, but many of our senators state that such changes demand such supply that Acre does not have. The impact of this change is one that only time will tell."
ACR_cut_ties_with_outside_world_desc:0 "To become significant to the junta, sacrifices are to be made, the one meaning the end of all diplomatic relations with all other breakaway nations that followed the Brazilian Civil War. With one exception being the Military Junta, of course. Will we lose some friends? Yes. Nevertheless, in the end it will be worth it, since we are bound to rise on the food chain of Amazonas and be its Apex Predator."
ACR_reach_out_to_junta_desc:0 "Finally, with all reforms completed, it is time to contact and begin close relations with the BMJ. It took us a lot of hard work to get us where we are now and we are not going to waste it. We will ask for men, supplies, or to simply put it, their support for fighting the ERN. There is no going back after this, so from now on we are bound to be walking a thin line: keep the balance."
ACR_acre_exists_desc:0 "“…AND WE ARE ITS PEOPLE! THERE IS A DEMON IN THE OUR WOODS, IT IS THE DEMON THAT DESCENDED THE GLOBE IN NUCLEAR FIRE, AND IT WILL NOT STOP UNTIL IT CONQUERS ALL OF WHAT'S LEFT, SO HE CAN CONDEMN US AGAIN INTO MORE SUFFERING. WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS. BE OUR MIND AND SWORD, SO WE WILL BE YOUR BODY AND SHIELD! GIVE US A TASK AND WILL FULFILL IT! DEATH TO THE ERN! GLORY FOR ACRE AND THE JUNTA!”"
ACR_joao_get_your_gun_desc:0 "Acre is not the most populated place in the Amazon, even when Brazil was still united, and this is a problem. But our army needs all the manpower we can get for our goals to be achieved, so a conscription law shall be enacted to make up for it. All adults serve, so grab your rifle soldier, and welcome to the Army!"
ACR_anti_bolivian_sentiment_desc:0 "Now with the Junta’s backing, we are slowly starting to force the propaganda into everyday life. Firstly being the posters of the Bolivian menace, and as time passes we will begin television shows, school plays, use The Gazeta do Acre and other major news outlets into publishing the horrors and Dangers of Communism and so on. Given time the people will think that we are at the moral high ground and soon after that."
ACR_hide_our_true_colours_desc:0 "Our senators are pathetic and foolish. What have they ever done? What have they ever proposed that wasn’t against our people's intentions? What are their true motives that they intentionally hide? With all said above, this can’t go on like this. We need to overthrow the republic. The militarists already are working on possible ways on how we can do it, but for now, we play along their game."
ACR_give_seats_to_former_military_desc:0 "We have struck gold and bound together a plan. Were going to replace the current security guards of the congress chamber with Nabor Junior and Jose Guiomard, Two of Cerqueira closest allies, in the company of their jingoists, and strike the senate while in session. We’ll demand the recession of all the senators that don’t support our cause and replace them with our nationalists."
ACR_national_conscription_act_desc:0 "With the power currently grasped in our hands, we can finally start the preparations for the inativable war against the ERN. The National Conscription Act will increase the maximum age and turn down the requirements needed for a conscription to the army. With it passed, we can start preparing a capable and sizable army to fight the red menace, this will surpass the guerrilla tactics that they foolishly use."
ACR_national_rearment_act_desc:0 "Now we are doing something that many people, influential or not, are going to see as absurd, which is a new law that gives the government constitutional rights to disarm all civilians and tappers, with the intention to give these guns to the state in an effort to strengthen the army. This will be certainly be seen as a violation to the rights of all, damage our stability and war support, but orders are orders."
ACR_force_a_stage_of_siege_desc:0 "Going another step further, Cerqueira is now calling all the people in our government to declare a state of emergency, reason being the increasing presence of Che and the ERN in our borders, saying also that they are planning to strike soon enough. Many of us think that he’s outright creating tension on purpose, since there’s not a single report reporting increasing activity there."
ACR_show_our_true_colours_desc:0 "We are ready. We are ready to reveal who we truly are. Our plans, motives and hearts will be revealed to the public. We are tiring of hiding ourselves from the spotlight and being the puppet of the republic for so long, and being a lap dog is outrageous. After this, there is now going back. We also don’t know what the general opinion will be, so be prepared for unforeseen consequences."
ACR_siege_senate_desc:0 "Time to react, and fast. We are going to strike the senate for the second time, with the twist being that we're going to tear down the republic and replace it with a government loyal to the Junta. Cerqueira's followers, supporters and Brazilian nationalists will siege the congress chamber and declare, as Cerqueira said himself, that the Acrean republic is illegitimate."
ACR_strip_land_of_men_desc:0 "We need an army, and if we want to stand a chance against Che and his goons we will go overboard with our conscription requirements. Lower them, and pump up the maximum age! Conscript the homeless, the poor and the undesirables! Make the population see reason, and destroy any and all defiants! Do anything but above all else give the army more men!"
ACR_tappers_no_desc:0 "Our ever growing and powerful army will need it’s increasing demand for more men, and we’ve found the perfect candidates. The rubber fields are, in our eyes, a waste of resources that could be relocated for more important subjects. We are conscripting their workers into the troops, all of them. In the past the rubber fields we’re important to our economy, now no more. With this, we’re surely beating anything the world can throw at us..."
ACR_soldiers_desc:0 "…and even more! Heck we could say we have the best army in the amazon! Che and any fool will fear us! Long live Cerqueira and our beloved homeland with all its glory!"
ACR_jail_opposition_desc:0 "This will become a big problem if not dealt soon. Many ex-senators from the old republic are broadcasting live on radio, telling the people of our nation to “not give up” and a bunch of other nonsense. Cerqueira has given us orders to shut down and burn the stations to the ground. And finally label these people as terrorists, to make them think twice before contradict our rule."
ACR_erase_acrean_nationalism_desc:0 "Brazil is not lost. It's alive and breathing, but nevertheless it’s struggling. Some think it is dead and we were one of those people, but now we’ve changed. Now it’s the time to toss aside foolish ideas of independence and reunite under the Brazilian flag with all its glory. We are the people of Acre, but we will be forever Brazilians."
ACR_join_war_desc:0 "With all war preparations clear and wanting for orders, we can now firmly join the struggle on reuniting all of Brazil. This will be difficult but the Junta has assured us that they will provide any request we have to make. Our military staff is pretty confident that we can handle anything the jungle throws at us, To arms! We are the heroes! For Brazil!"
ACR_refuse_constitution_desc:0 "To know that we still use the old republic’s constitution is something really worrying, because why? Why do we have such a mess that defines what we must obey and not to do? It has so many flaws that don’t allow us to do what everyone thinks it’s right? With all said, we’re going to rewrite this and make a brand new one. it will take some time but it needs to be much better than the old one."
ACR_embrace_brazil_desc:0 "Oh yes, the Brazilian constitution. It 's so right, like everything on it, we could even say it’s perfect. Our nation has every piece set up in place, like a chessboard, to rightfully adopt and use it, we just need some sewell time to make sure we don’t do anything wrong and that no one tries to stop it."
ACR_acrean_military_command_desc:0 "We’ve gone through so many changes in such little time. We’ve gone to a tyrant republic to our proud dictatorship, people see us as heroes for standing out for them, fighting for them, and hopefully this will be the last one in a long time: Just a simple name change, to represent what we’ve become now."
ACR_acre_ameo_desc:0 "Finally, after all this time, of preparation, coordination and rehabilitation of the army, we are ready. We are ready for what we set out to achieve of what we planned since the beginning, and with the junta support, we are sure more capable enough to defeat this demon. Che must be ready, because we are here, sound and preparable, just wanting to sound the drums of war."

ACR_carneiro_presidency_desc:0 "Following Marques’s failed administration during his time in office the diarchy of the Technocratic Party was left without it’s first head, as such Enéas Carneiro was left no choice but to fill the now empty seat of power, taking with it the responsibility of putting the victorious but wounded nation back on its feet."
ACR_rebuild_the_nation_desc:0 "The recent conflicts deeply hurt the republic on a Political level, the devastation caused by the military on both sides and the death of important political figures like Hélio Cury leaving deep wounds in the still young political structure of the nation, and empty seats to be refilled."
ACR_celebrate_with_militarists_desc:0 "There are those who celebrate our victory despite the losses, amongst them the remaining members of the Militarist Party who viciously cheer the fall of Che and Marques alike, and, despite his previous associations, sympathies run both ways between President Carneiro and them, leading to increasingly strong ties."
ACR_deal_with_cerqueira_desc:0 "After Enéas’s takeover of the Technocratic Party Cerqueira’s loyalty was once again put in question, with many of his closest followers now questioning what his real intentions really are, we can bring Cerqueira back into Acre’s fold or use this moment of weakness to eradicate the problem once and for all."
ACR_to_the_victor_the_spoils_desc:0 "Che’s downfall although not expected, is welcomed, and along with the territory of Rondônia it leaves our nation with plenty of captured weapons, maps, documents and plans ignored by the Bolivian government and abandoned by Che’s retrieting forces, all things that we can put into use."
ACR_show_a_light_to_the_nationalists_desc:0 "Hélio’s untimely death brought a sense of malaise and despair to the Nationalist party as a whole, now locked in a stasis without it’s Tupiniquim ladies-man to lead them, they however still control a huge amount of power within the nation and can be easily reorientated under a new figure’s guidance."
ACR_reviving_helios_dream_desc:0 "And that figure is Enéas, with a new proposition, the Nationalists goals although noble naturally limit themselves to Acre’s borders and near proximities, with Enéas on the helm the Nationalist’s scope have expanded greatly now searching to make Acre a fighting player in the reunification of Brazil."
ACR_taking_over_the_technocrats_desc:0 "Marques’s was full of passion but ultimately failed in what he wished to accomplish, peace to Acre and the wellbeing of its people, regardless of this there are still a few who wish to challenge Enéas’s sovereignty as leader of the party and put themselves as the new second head of the technocrats, something that cannot be reasonably allowed."
ACR_deciding_marques_fate_in_history_desc:0 "Marques may have survived the bloodshed but his reputation surely didn’t, it falls to his successor to decide if exploiting this is a wise decision or not, erasing him from history could bring stability to the republic at the price of ignorance, but making him a martyr of the poor could do just the same, with different shockwaves."
ACR_found_the_prona_desc:0 "Almost by circumstance Carneiro finds himself as the de facto head of all parties, an opportunity that if wasted now would never be achieved again. By unanimous vote in the Senate of Rio Branco all 3 parties will be joined into one, the PRONA, the “Party for the Rectification of National Order”, under Enéas ominous overseeing."
ACR_matters_of_national_reedification_desc:0 "Acre’s goals are now Enéas’s, we now stand as a fighting competitor in Brazil’s reunification war not aiming to only survive as an independent nation, the race to make Acre a worthy competitor has now begun."
ACR_nationalize_rondonia_desc:0 "The Territory of Rondônia was an unexpected prize upon defeating Che, the territory falling onto Acre’s hands almost by chance when it was suddenly repopulated by a rush of immigrants seeking Acre’s wealth and fleeing the raging war on Mato Grosso once the Guerrilla retreated, we must be quick to make it part of the Republic before it slips our grasp."
ACR_rondonia_testing_grounds_desc:0 "Rondônia is more than just worthless jungle for us to grow latex on, it is our future main front against the Junta or Republic and as such must be prepared for the occasion, the population will be relocated to Porto Velho and the south used exclusively to military purposes, laying fortifications, hiding weapon caches, and experimenting new toys…"
ACR_fake_smiles_and_hand_shakes_desc:0 "The rubber must flow for the Republic to stay alive and with that we see ourselves once again forced to work with the Manauan oligarchies, we’ll send a diplomat to ensure that whatever despot rules the heart of the Amazon of our good intentions, at least for now."
ACR_ears_on_manaus_desc:0 "Along with the diplomat Manaus will receive a flow of new guests, government agents disguised as anything from merchants to members of the high society, members of all social layers who all report back to Rio Branco with news and information from every corner of that rotten city."
ACR_hands_on_mato_grosso_desc:0 "The state of Mato Grosso lives in a sorry state, ravaged by war and smashed by Filinto’s iron fist, the outskirts of it falling to anarchy and the control of loggers or tribal warlords, a prime opportunity for our forces to move in and secure control before someone else does so."
ACR_secure_the_upper_amazon_desc:0 "Expansion downriver is a much awaited and discussed topic in the senate’s halls, and the assertion of our sovereignty over it has finally been greenlighted by President Carneiro, we will, however, try to not interfere with any local powerhouses until we have more information on then, and can therefore act more efficiently."
ACR_fluvial_supremacy_desc:0 "First experiences with eastward expansion proved that a peaceful manifest destiny would not be achieved, and early engagements showed the importance of fluvial dominance when dealing with troop and equipment transport, communication, direct and guerrilla warfare and even recoincense, we shall adapt to this new reality and warfare."
ACR_buy_out_the_neblina_desc:0 "North of the Jaú sits an abominable violation of Brazil’s national borders, a clear insult to our nation's pride and glory, or what's left of it. We can’t however waste time and resources with a war against Venezuela, but we can put these mercenaries to use, by paying a not insignificant fee we can organize them into a fighting force on our side."
ACR_economy_and_army_desc:0 "We learned much from Che, wanting us or not, but now we prepare to face new enemies each of them needing increasingly diverse tactics, we must prepare to face every matter of technological level, terrain, strategy and army size if we wish to accomplish our goals."
ACR_triple_the_army_size_desc:0 "The power of a state is only defined by its ability to secure its national borders, and if necessary, to expand them, if necessary, by force. Acre’s ability to do so at its current state is debatable at best and it’s quick expansion quickly worsens it, it is time we fix it."
ACR_army_whatever_desc:0 "The army has taught much to President Carneiro during his brief time in it, much more than just anesthesiology, it taught him the value of order, a strict hierarchy and comradeship. All things that when applied to civilian life lead to the building of an exemplary citizen, it is for the benefit of all in the nation that these values be forced upon it, specially in times like these."
ACR_riverines:0 "Our immediate objective is to secure the states of Amazonas, Rondônia, Roraima and Pará, two of which are already under our control, but it becomes clear each passing day that conventional warfare will not be applicable in our current situation. The same way of thinking will be applied once we move to the remaining Brazilian states once their time comes, but now, we focus on the Frogmen."
ACR_nationalize_the_rubber_industry_desc:0 "Acre cannot allow itself to fall on the hands of oligarchs like Manaus did, privatization is nothing but negotiations made to transfer the formidable public assets to a privileged minority, and no sane man who loves his country would ever allow this to happen."
ACR_the_state_controls_all_desc:0 "It is fact that absolute freedom leads to a true massacre of the weakest by the strongest, we need the state to be a strong intervening hand so that order, justice, equal opportunities and the right to work, housing, education, health, transport and the healthy need to create wealth, intervening, if necessary, in production and the economy as a whole can be preserved."
ACR_soldiers_heroes_leaders_desc:0 "Respect for the armed forces was a keynote not only of our population but of all others in existence, it must be upheld as high as possible if we wish it to uphold the state in return, and in times of great struggle and bloodshed such as these there is no lack of brave figures for to turn into war heroes, and if any other interesting skills show themselves, leaders."
ACR_the_greatest_log_house_desc:0 "The University of Rio Branco, or the Great Oca as it is sometimes called, is a beacon of progress and enlightenment to the world, and as its overseers it falls to the government the responsibility of upholding and expanding it beyond its basic academical use and to turn it into a true shining light in the darkness of the jungle."
ACR_anthropology_lessons_desc:0 "As part of this year’s curriculum a series of Anthropology lessons will be conducted in Rio Branco, tutored by none other than the president himself, although it has been pointed out that such activities may interfere negatively with his time in office those complaints have been summarily ignored by Carneiro, his thirst for knowledge seemingly infinite."
ACR_uphold_anthropophagic_ideals_desc:0 ""Tupy, or not tupy that is the question.” said Oswald, mocking the submission of the Brazilian elite to more developed countries in the 20’s, and we must pose ourselves the same question. We must swallow the Brazilian, Northeastern, Hispanic and Amerindian culture so that we can create a real Acre identity, one made specifically to serve in our favor."
ACR_carlos_drummond_de_andrade_desc:0 "Acre’s intellectual growth has not gone unnoticed and brought the attention of a particularly impressive figure, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, one of the fathers of Brazilian Modernism. His mere presence in the republic is enough for it to freeze awaiting the inevitable clash between Carlos and Enéas in the halls of the Great Oca."
ACR_attract_intellectuals_desc:0 "It is almost ironic how the heart of the Amazon would become a safe spot for philosophers, writers, artists and artsy types alike, even more ironic to think it would be ruled by an enlightened despot such as Enéas but nonetheless it shall become reality, Acre will open its doors to those fleeing the wars and devastation on their countries and become a true poet’s republic."
ACR_eneas_inner_circle_desc:0 "With so many great minds floking to Acre a golden opportunity of self enlightenment presents itself to the president, that of surrounding himself with the greatest artists and philosophers of the century, or at least those that remain, and to indulge in their works."
ACR_the_silver_library_desc:0 "The repressive regime of the Argentine Junta forced an exodus of potentially dangerous thinkers out of the country and of those by it invaded, we can open our doors to these waywards poets and add them to our Platonic republic."
ACR_new_research_facilities_desc:0 "Wing X of the University of Rio Branco will receive its biggest expansion yet, in a combined effort with the Military it will receive top of the line equipment, using the recent influx of researchers and great minds to satisfy the needs of our rapidly growing military."
ACR_the_best_of_the_best_desc:0 "A great university is only great for its content, for the skill of the people lecturing and administering it, why should a state be any different? What sense does it make to allow the ignorant masses to ever come near power when we have a selection of geniuses to handpick from!"
ACR_a_state_run_by_reason_desc:0 "To guarantee the longevity of our state we must guarantee that progress won’t simply be undone 4 years down the line by some illiterate fool like Marques, and to do that while preserving our democracy we will simply remove the right of vote from the ignorant ones, Acre shall have its future leaders elected on the basis on knowledge and preparation alone."
ACR_the_race_for_equity_desc:0 "With the internal machinations of the republic well oiled and prepared we can now focus fully on our most vital task, securing the Amazon rainforest and equaling ourselves to our future foes, so that we may talk on equal terms."
