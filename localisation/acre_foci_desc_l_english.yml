 ACR_the_1967_constitution_desc:0 "In 1963 after the republic’s founding it was decided that a constitution must be written, not by one man or a group, but by the people, now after 5 years that can finally be done."
 ACR_minorities_no_desc:0 "The discussion about the native case is over, it was decided that the best option for coexistence with them is separation, some of these voices seem honest about their decision, some appear to be based on petty racism, regardless, the vote is now over."

 ACR_defend_in_the_cities_desc:0 "When Che Guevara first attacked years before our most astonishing victory came in the city of Brasiléia, it has become clear that Che has little experience in an urban environment, we shall use this to our advantage."
 ACR_defend_in_the_jungle_desc:0 "Acre is a place of thick and dense jungle with few civilized places, although Che Guevara’s men are used to fighting in such terrain it is also the perfect place to wage a defensive war."
 ACR_conscription_law_desc:0 "What we call a defense force is constituted of a series of independent militias that operate autonomously, that often leads to problems like infighting between militias and abuse of power, they are however all united under the goal of protecting Acre’s people, and therefore will listen to the government once we take action to control then, the question is, how will we do this. "

 ACR_involvement_of_the_army_in_politics_desc:0 "The Militaristic party has fomented a most unusual discussion in the senate, they argue that members of the armed forces should have extra power when discussing politics, or even have exclusive rights within the senate emulating ancient Rome’s senatorial system, although some find this to be ridiculous the vote was called anyway, and the results were..."
 ACR_the_senate_desc:0 "The Senate of Rio Branco is an effort to bring the distant and dispersed voices of the communities of Acre together under a single roof, so that they can, together, decide Acre’s road forward, it has proven to be a massive headache so far but after many years of preparation progress has finally began..."

Some claim however that such drastic measures so early in the Republic’s lifetime could prove catastrophic."
 ACR_finish_the_constitution_desc:0 "All decisions made, all senators present, all parties assembled together under one roof, today is the great day when Acre will become a true country, founded by principles set in paper but made of steel, and now, finally, the Senate can come together once more and vote for the Acre’s Republic first President."

ACR_marques_presidency_desc:0 "Marques de Souza, champion of workers's rights and leader of the Technocratic faction, has triumphed. Having been narrowly elected President of the Acrean Republic, the new leader has been lauded by rubber tappers and impoverished as much as he is demonized by corporations and businessmen. All now wait eagerly for the firebrand's first actions in office."
ACR_worker_cause_desc:0 "Without workers, a nation is nothing. So why do laborers continue to suffer under trinket wages, horrible conditions, and brutal treatment? Why do their corporate overlords treat them as if they were slaves of antiquity? President de Souza will waste no time. He will take the battle for the worker to the Senate."
ACR_compromise_with_nationalists_desc:0 "Perhaps we judged the Nationalists too harshly. While they are certainly not perfect, we can agree with them on many counts. Their fight for the legal equality of natives, for instance, is admirable. We will throw them a bone and offer to pass some legislation in accordance with their platform - if they'd do the same with ours."
ACR_compromise_with_militarists_two_desc:0 "The Militarists are our enemy. Their leaders are openly hostile towards our fairly elected government, and rumors of a planned coup are even surfacing. Yet, we also need their votes in order to pass our reforms. A deal with the devil will be offered. We will support those of their initiatives which are not entirely disagreeable, should they vote for ours."
ACR_promise_to_limit_reforms_desc:0 "Our radical promises and changes to labor policy and rights has alarmed even some moderates within our faction. Now that we have struck a compromise with our political opponents, we will publicly dial back the reforms and begin acting on our promises, all in the name of ensuring their votes."
ACR_haha_sike_desc:0 "...or not. While we need to keep up a facade of moderation in public, piecemeal reform and limited change will not suffice here. To keep our opponents in the dark about our true policies, we will control the press and flow of information through censorship, replacing coverage of our legislation with entertainment such as TV shows and plays."

ACR_generic_education_desc:0 "We all think that the books that our children get should be the ones that are the best, so they can develop critical thinking and skills that can be used later down in life. If otherwise, our system that they will inherit could collapse from inexperience."
ACR_selected_books_desc:0 "Let’s be honest, children must be guided by their parents, or else they would get lost in a world of supposed “free choice”. We can’t let them choose another philosophy different than ours, that would mean our demise.

ACR_desperate_negotiations_desc:0 "Time has been going fast since Che Guevara attacked us. All of our government cabinets have been in high tension since then. Sure we stopped his offensive, but everyone believes he will do it for a second time. We directed all of our nation’s resources into contacting Che, and hopefully we can sort everything out."
ACR_flirt_with_communists_desc:0 "Che Guevara lies just bellow us in Bolivia with his army, and they may prove themselves useful for our national interests.

ACR_holding_hands_with_che_desc:0 "As part of our continues effort of maintaining good relations, Che has said on radio that he will send one of his most trusted advisors to be his representative for future agreements. Great news, since this will mean faster and greater opportunities for collaboration with them. meanwhile, as always, being the ones benefiting on the end of the bargain."
ACR_ask_for_a_kiss_desc:0 "We have reached a point that we could now ask for more closer or personal with our relationship with Marques and Che, with that being to establish trade and trade routes with the ERN. We will convince and request permission with his advisor and wait for a response by the other party."
ACR_ask_for_permission_to_go_deeper_desc:0 "Now with the trade routes established, we will petition something riskier, which is the access to the ERN rivers and the Madre de Dios river system for further trading opportunities.

If our selves want to mean anything to them, we need to make their military staff, their way of governing and thinking identical to ours. Cerqueira is rolling out major reforms with all of it in mind, but many of our senators state that such changes demand such supply that Acre does not have. The impact of this change is one that only time will tell."
ACR_cut_ties_with_outside_world_desc:0 "To become significant to the junta, sacrifices are to be made, the one meaning the end of all diplomatic relations with all other breakaway nations that followed the Brazilian Civil War. With one exception being the Military Junta, of course. Will we lose some friends? Yes. Nevertheless, in the end it will be worth it, since we are bound to rise on the food chain of Amazonas and be its Apex Predator."
ACR_reach_out_to_junta_desc:0 "Finally, with all reforms completed, it is time to contact and begin close relations with the BMJ. It took us a lot of hard work to get us where we are now and we are not going to waste it. We will ask for men, supplies, or to simply put it, their support for fighting the ERN. There is no going back after this, so from now on we are bound to be walking a thin line: keep the balance."

But our army needs all the manpower we can get for our goals to be achieved, so a conscription law shall be enacted to make up for it. All adults serve, so grab your rifle soldier, and welcome to the Army!"
ACR_anti_bolivian_sentiment_desc:0 "Now with the Junta’s backing, we are slowly starting to force the propaganda into everyday life. Firstly being the posters of the Bolivian menace, and as time passes we will begin television shows, school plays, use The Gazeta do Acre and other major news outlets into publishing the horrors and Dangers of Communism and so on. Given time and effort, the people will think that we are at the moral high ground and soon after that."
ACR_hide_our_true_colours_desc:0 "Our senators are pathetic and foolish. What have they ever done? What have they ever proposed that wasn’t against our people's intentions? What are their true motives that they intentionally hide? With all said above, this can’t go on like this. We need to overthrow the republic. The militarists already are working on possible ways on how we can do it, but for now, we play along their game."
ACR_give_seats_to_former_military_desc:0 "We have struck gold and bound together a plan. Were going to replace the current security guards of the congress chamber with Nabor Junior and Jose Guiomard, Two of Cerqueira closest allies, in the company of their jingoists, and strike the senate while in session. We’ll demand the recession of all the senators that don’t support our cause and replace them with our nationalists."
ACR_national_conscription_act_desc:0 "With the power currently grasped in our hands, we can finally start the preparations for the inativable war against the ERN. The National Conscription Act will increase the maximum age and turn down the requirements needed for a conscription to the army. With it passed, we can start preparing a capable and sizable army to fight the red menace, this will surpass the guerrilla tactics that they foolishly use."
ACR_national_rearment_act_desc:0 "Now we are doing something that many people, influential or not, are going to see as absurd, which is a new law that gives the government constitutional rights to disarm all civilians and tappers, with the intention to give these guns to the state in an effort to strengthen the army. This will be certainly be seen as a violation to the rights of all, damage our stability and war support, but orders are orders."
ACR_force_a_stage_of_siege_desc:0 "Going another step further, Cerqueira is now calling all the people in our government to declare a state of emergency, reason being the increasing presence of Che and the ERN in our borders, saying also that they are planning to strike soon enough. Many of us think that he’s outright creating tension on purpose, since there’s not a single report reporting increasing activity there."
ACR_show_our_true_colours_desc:0 "We are ready. We are ready to reveal who we truly are. Our plans, motives and hearts will be revealed to the public. We are tiring of hiding ourselves from the spotlight and being the puppet of the republic for so long, and being a lap dog is outrageous. After this, there is now going back. We also don’t know what the general opinion will be, so be prepared for unforeseen consequences."
ACR_siege_senate_desc:0 "Time to react, and fast. We are going to strike the senate for the second time, with the twist being that we're going to tear down the republic and replace it with a government loyal to the Junta. Cerqueira's followers, supporters and Brazilian nationalists will siege the congress chamber and declare, as Cerqueira said himself, that the Acrean republic is illegitimate."
ACR_strip_land_of_men_desc:0 "We need an army, and if we want to stand a chance against Che and his goons we will go overboard with our conscription requirements. Lower them, and pump up the maximum age! Conscript the homeless, the poor and the undesirables! Make the population see reason, and destroy any and all defiants! Do anything but above all else give the army more men!"

ACR_jail_opposition_desc:0 "This will become a big problem if not dealt soon. Many ex-senators from the old republic are broadcasting live on radio, telling the people of our nation to “not give up” and a bunch of other nonsense. Cerqueira has given us orders to shut down and burn the stations to the ground. And finally label these people as terrorists, to make them think twice before contradict our rule."
ACR_erase_acrean_nationalism_desc:0 "Brazil is not lost. It's alive and breathing, but nevertheless it’s struggling. Some think it is dead and we were one of those people, but now we’ve changed. Now it’s the time to toss aside foolish ideas of independence and reunite under the Brazilian flag with all its glory. We are the people of Acre, but we will be forever Brazilians."
ACR_join_war_desc:0 "With all war preparations clear and wanting for orders, we can now firmly join the struggle on reuniting all of Brazil. This will be difficult but the Junta has assured us that they will provide any request we have to make. Our military staff is pretty confident that we can handle anything the jungle throws at us, To arms! We are the heroes! For Brazil!"
ACR_refuse_constitution_desc:0 "To know that we still use the old republic’s constitution is something really worrying, because why? Why do we have such a mess that defines what we must obey and not to do? It has so many flaws that don’t allow us to do what everyone thinks it’s right? With all said, we’re going to rewrite this and make a brand new one. it will take some time but it needs to be much better than the old one."
ACR_embrace_brazil_desc:0 "Oh yes, the Brazilian constitution. It 's so right, like everything on it, we could even say it’s perfect. Our nation has every piece set up in place, like a chessboard, to rightfully adopt and use it, we just need some sewell time to make sure we don’t do anything wrong and that no one tries to stop it."
ACR_acrean_military_command_desc:0 "We’ve gone through so many changes in such little time. We’ve gone to a tyrant republic to our proud dictatorship, people see us as heroes for standing out for them, fighting for them, and hopefully this will be the last one in a long time: Just a simple name change, to represent what we’ve become now."
ACR_acre_ameo_desc:0 "Finally, after all this time, of preparation, coordination and rehabilitation of the army, we are ready. We are ready for what we set out to achieve of what we planned since the beginning, and with the junta support, we are sure more capable enough to defeat this demon. Che must be ready, because we are here, sound and preparable, just wanting to sound the drums of war."
