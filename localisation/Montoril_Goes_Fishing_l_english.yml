This is the most evolved group of fish in the world. Around the globe we find hundreds of species that represent the most diverse groups of fish from rivers and oceans. The peacock bass evolved in the group of the most efficient predators of the Cichlids group. Its ferocity, its strength, its speed, and its remarkable size allows it to predominate over almost all other species. Its huge mouth can surprisingly swallow large prey, making any fish smaller than it a good candidate for dinner, it is like a sea bass with steroids. Fifteen different species have already been cataloged in the Amazon basin.\n \n It has bright colors and is called "Açu" in Brazil or "3-bar" in the USA. They become heavier and more "square" due to pre-spawning changes, with mature gonads.\n \n The identification of Cichla Temensis is more complex due to the morphological variability. The specimens are found in two very distinct color and pattern phases, with a series of intermediate stages corresponding to their degree of reproductive preparation. The transformation process is gradual - the bars darken, the colors lighten and the white spots disappear. Paca Metamorphosis has white or yellow dots arranged in four distinct longitudinal lines. Both forms have 3 distinct dark bars along the sides of the body and a distinct black stripe or speckled markings from the eye to the end of the opercular bone, without ocelli on the sides or at the base of the second dorsal"

The fry are light gray with dark spots scattered on the upper half of the body. The tambaqui reaches about 90cm in total length. In the past, specimens weighing up to 45kg were captured. Today, because of overfishing, there are practically no such individuals. Migratory species, performs reproductive, trophic and dispersal migrations. During the flood season, it enters the flooded forest, where it feeds on fruits / seeds. During drought, young individuals stay in lowland lakes where they feed on zooplankton and adults migrate to rivers to spawn. At that time, they do not eat, living on the fat they accumulated during the full season. One of the most important commercial species in the central Amazon."

It reaches about 1m in total length and over 5.5kg. In the Negro River there is also a darker-colored ferreira species. \n \n Ecology; The arowana lives on the lakeside, along igapós or aquatic grasses, always on the lookout for insects (mainly beetles) and spiders that fall into the water. It is probably the largest fish in the world whose diet consists mainly of insects and spiders. Nothing just below the surface with the barbels projected forward, but the function of the barbels is still unknown. In low-oxygen waters, barbels can be used to obtain oxygen on the water's surface. The most characteristic aspect of the arowana's feeding behavior is the ability to jump out of the water and catch prey still on the trunks, branches and vines. An adult individual can jump more than 1 meter out of the water. The species reproduces during the flood, and the males keep the eggs and larvae in their mouths (barbels also serve to guide the larvae to the male's mouth when they go out to feed). The fry achieve high commercial value as ornamental fish."
