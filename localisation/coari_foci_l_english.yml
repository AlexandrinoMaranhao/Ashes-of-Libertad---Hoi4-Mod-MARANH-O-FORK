 COR_intro_one_desc:0 "How did we get here?"
 COR_intro_two_desc:0 "Who is Alexandre Montoril?"
 COR_intro_three_desc:0 "What is the city of Coari?"
 COR_intro_final_desc:0 "Coari was once a shinning example of what can be achieved when good people work together for a common goal, but the apocalypse was not kind to it, the Pearl of Solimões doesn't shine anymore, obscured by the shadows of starving crowds."
 COR_church_desc:0 "The Parish of Sant'Ana is for many their last hope, in this troubling times many people turn to god seeking help and salvation, and the priests there are happy to help, but as time goes by it becomes clear that god has already forgotten us."
 COR_militia_question_desc:0 "Desperation can make good men crazy, that has become apparent, street fights over medicine or clothes have become everyday things and reports of murders and linchings have started to pop up in the last months, if people refuse to act civilized we will have to force them to do so."
 COR_mercenary_militia_desc:0 "In terms of money, we have no money, but Montoril has offered to trade basically everything he has for a mercenary force from Santarém, the Mercenary Capital of the Amazon, he and a small band of brave man will depart in boats loaded to the brim with furniture, vases, paintings and small golden trinkets to Santarém, let's hope they find this enough"
 COR_local_militia_desc:0 "- CITIZEN PAY ATTENTION - Join today Mayor Montoril's Militia, help bring order and safety back to our home, we offer medical assistence and food for those who join, Enlist Today!"
 COR_1961_craze_desc:0 "TREMBLE, FOR THE RED NAVY COMES"
 COR_pray_for_help_desc:0 "Faith is running low now, medical assistence has devolved into priests watching and conforting people dying from common diseases, communal communal dinners never seem to have enough food and consist almost entirelly of bananas and fish, people are tired and quicly getting angry."
 COR_the_american_priest_desc:0 "Francis Hirsch is a well known priest in the Frairy of Sant'Ana, headmaster of the seminary and the man behind the Craze of 61, a man that holds a no insignificant ammount of power in the city, Montoril has to make sure he won't cause any more trouble from now on."
 COR_steal_from_monastery_desc:0 "Enough praying, no one will ever answer anyway, if god refuses to help us them screw him we'll do it ourselves, break in the church, grab their golden crosses and fancy robes, drink their wine and share of their bread, some may call this barbaric but we can't expect god to do all the work."
 COR_open_the_market_desc:0 "The sacking of the frairy was... unfortunate, but it opens up some opportunities, we now posses all the stolen loot and it is worth quite a lot if sold to the right people, we may get excommunicated by doing so but selling these goods in Manaus in exchange for medicine and guns is our best option for survival, God never helped us anyway."
 COR_find_guns_desc:0 "The military when it left Coari forgot some things, amongst them a few guns, many boxes of ammo and even a few maps, we will take those for ourselves and ask civilians to surrender any guns they might have for hunting or self defence and give them to the mayor's Militia."
 COR_arms_factory_desc:0 "Amongst the things forgotten there are a few blueprints and weapon repair kits, we have carpenters and mechanics amongst the civilians in Coari, we'll give those blueprints to them and hopefully they will be able to make some weapons, even if crude looking at first."
 COR_organize_a_raid_desc:0 "Still, not enough, we may not have much but we do have a reasonably organized force of bearded, strong, mean looking men with guns, perfect for intimidating nearby smaller communities into ''sharing'' some of their stuff with us." 
 COR_desperate_measures_desc:0 "It's not enough, it never is, the city is dying and we are forced to watch as it decays in front of our very eyes without being able to do anything about it, we'll have to take more severe actions to ensure survival, force the civilians to hand all their guns, all food is now shared, institute martial law if necessary, the city must survive at all costs."
 COR_ask_for_help_desc:0 "This is not the first letter we sent to the Brazilian government, both to the Junta and Republic, but after 5 years of abbandonment it may just be the last, in any case, we ask them for help one more time, maybe this time they will answer."
 COR_go_hunting_desc:0 "Men, get your boats, get your guns, we're going fishing today. Not for fish, obviously, we're looking for vulnerable villages packed with resources we desperately need to survive, afterall, we deserve them more then they do."
 COR_fishing_spot_desc:0 "So many options, where do we go first?"
 COR_go_down_desc:0 "We can travel south and navigate the many afluents of the Amazon river, there's not much there besides small riverside villages and isolated native settlements, but deep south lies the Acre Republic, slowly getting stronger, maybe we can get something from it if we play our cards right."
