 the_red_menace_desc:0 "Bolívia, Acre's arch-nemesis (if we ignore all the others), an ever present Menace to Acre's young sovereignty and it's people, the fear of another invasion by the Northern Revolutionary Army both paralyzes and readies the nation to another round of fighting. We can only hope we can once again best the might of Che Guevara once the time to fight comes."
 the_cabanos_desc:0 "When Filinto Müller and the AMC purged the Araguaia river from its guerrilla the battered survivors fled north through the amazon’s rich river system, spreading like fire in dry grass. Although they are disorganized and demoralized they keep being a problem, a constant reminder of the dangers of communism."
 the_juntas_favorite_pet_desc:0 "Pará is a rare example of competence within the Brazilian Military Junta, even with its problems the state continues to function with remarkable loyalty and efficiency, and it is rewarded greatly by doing it, like the proud owner of a beautiful dog the Junta answers to Pará’s every desire as long as it keeps proving itself a capable, useful ally."

 what_are_we_fighting_for_desc:0 "The decision to keep itself neutral in the ongoing conflict in Brazil at first looked like a smart decision, a way to keep the conflict away from the jungle and its people. \nIt, however, led to the AMC being drained of resources by both the Republic and Junta in an effort to keep itself in good terms with both leading to infighting between soldiers and officers loyal to each party. \nUltimately, these were the cracks that broke the Amazonian Military Command."
 aripuana_tribe_desc:0 "The tribes of the Rio Aripuanã are sparse and ferocious. During the early 20th Century, the tribespeople of this area in the former state of Mato Grosso suffered catastrophically from disease and genocide brought by Brazilian rubber barons and gold miners. Some of the most notable of these tribes are the Mebêngôkre, Rikbaktsa, and the Aripuanã Macaws. All three tribes are skilled hunters and share a common enemy, the whites. The limited protections Brazilian law provided to the indiginous people of this region are now gone and the time for the tribes of the Rio Aripuanã to fight for their independence draws closer."
 zoe_tribe_desc:0 "The Zo'é are an undisturbed tribe situated between Erepecuru and Cuminapanema rivers in the thick rainforest of Pará. They are semi-nomadic people who are expert bow hunters. Whether the prey be tapir, peccary, monkey, or fish, The Zo'é have a specialized arrow for them ensuring the most effective hunt. During the rainy season, The Zo'é stops to grow cassava on small plantations. When the harvest is over, the tribe moves locations and begin cultivation again.The Zo'é paint themselves red with black designs, whilst leaving their faces clear. The most defining features of the Zo'é are the cylindrical ornaments in their lower lips known as “poturu”. Made from the bones of monkey legs, the poturu is a Zo'é tradition that represents a rite of passage and a signifier of their ethnicity. The Zo'é have lived undisturbed for hundreds, if not thousands of years and while the world unknown to them changes, the Zo'é’s peaceful isolation might soon be coming to an end."
 jutai_tribe_desc:0 "An extension of the Vale do Javari, many of the peoples living in Alto Jutaí are sparse and very isolated from the outside world. They live similar to the tribes in the rest of the Vale do Javari, hunter gatherers who temporarily settle to grow local staple crops such as cassava. The small tribes in this area have become prey to their neighboring tribes such as the Matsés who frequently war with them and abduct their women and children. In Alto Jutaí, peace is a relic of the past and its peoples’ chance of survival is narrowing."
 himerima_tribe_desc:0 "The Himarimã are a people who live in the mid-Piranha River and are fiercely devoted to their isolation.

 javari_tribe_desc:0 "The Vale do Javari is an area of land slightly larger than Austria that borders Peru and the State of Acre. While this vast area spans around 85,000 square kilometers, it only has a population of about 5,000 people separated into a dozen or so tribes, with the vast majority of them still uncontacted. While it might seem that these people are just as isolated as they are from “civilization” that is far from the case. Kidnappings, murder, and war is all too common. A couple of those who have distinguished themselves are the Korubo, who are known for their frequent use of war clubs and poisonous blow darts ; and the Matsés, who regularly raid villages, killing all the men and abducting the women. In the 1920s, the Matsés managed to acquire firearms and were trained to use them by a woman they had abducted from Peru. The future is unclear for the people of the Javari Valley, but one thing is for certain; they will not go down without a fight."
 jurua_tribe_desc:0 "On the border of Acre live the people settled between the Juruá and Purus Rivers. Thousands of people exist here encompassing many different tribes, most notably the Kanamari and the Kulina. The tribes here survive mostly off of gathering fruits, hunting turtles, and fishing. The history of contact between white explorers and the indigenous  started honest with occasional trading of metal tools for exotic plants thought to have medicinal purposes. However, this relationship soured during the Amazon rubber boom and led to a vicious cycle of bloodshed, slavery, and fear. Displaced and mistrustful, the tribes of Juruá warn their young of what the outside world may bring them, and soon their worst fears may come true."
 bia_tribe_desc:0 "The Biá River is a tributary of the greater Jutaí river. The peoples of Biá consist primarily of nomadic hunters who live primarily near the headwaters of the river. During the rubber boom, the land and people of Biá were left relatively undisturbed, this is due to the low quality of latex from the trees in this area, making it an unprofitable location to pillage and plunder. Native to Biá are the Tükuna, a nomadic tribe who adopted the ethonym “Kutakina” as this term implied they were a “docile” tribe rather than a “rebel” one by whites. In the 1940s, a tribe of the Kanamari people also settled in Biá as refugees, escaping from either rubber barons or another warring tribe. The tribes of Biá have had much more interactions with the outside world than their neighbors. Often, some Kanamari and Katukina leave their villages to live amongst the richer Peruvian and Brazilians."
 yanomami_tribe_desc:0 "The Yanomami are semi-nomadic people situated between the Orinoco and Branco Rivers.

Yanomami religion is shamanic, with shamans using “yakoana”, a power hallucinogen that is snorted through the nose which is used for spiritual healing and communicating with their gods.  Around 15 to 25 thousand Yanomami, incorporating several hundred villages, populated this area, spanning across the border of northern Brazil and southeastern Venezuela. Unbeknownst to them, the Yanomami sit upon large amounts of gold and other precious resources. Were prospectors to strike gold, it could be the Yanomami’s extinction."

The Waiãpi are experts in cultivating cassava, cashew, corn, and many other crops that contribute to the majority of their diets. They practice slash and burn agriculture to clear land for their harvest. Agriculture is so important to the Waiãpi that they have seasonal ceremonies related to the foods they eat (corn, fish, and honey) and the creation of humanity. Waiãpi interaction with the outside world started in the 1700s, defending their land from French Jesuits and Old World diseases ravaging their population. Without a unifying leader of their people and the fact that their native lands are upon rich quantities of precious minerals, the Waiãpi may be uprooted like a cassava and their lands harvested for profit"
 andira_tribe_desc:0 "The Sateré-Mawé of Andirá are part of the Tupi language family. Living along the Amazon River, the Sateré-Mawé are fishers, agriculturalists, and most surprisingly, materialists. The Sateré-Mawé culture of manufacturing material goods out of woven plants is a very important in their lives. The most unique woven goods they produce are the straw gloves woven and adorned with macaw and hawk feathers that are used in their rite of passage festival where Sateré-Mawé boys stick their hands into the gloves that are woven with ants of the genus paraponera clavata. The boys endure the stinging of the ants for minutes while performing a ritualistic dance as their body succumbs to the neurotoxins.The Sateré-Mawé were the first people to cultivate guaraná, a powerful stimulant richer in caffeine than coffee beans. The Sateré-Mawé have a history of warfare with their neighbors such as the Munduruku and white explorers. In the 1830s, the Sateré-Mawé joined forces against the Empire of Brazil in the War of Cabanos. Hopped up on guaraná and ant venom, the Sateré-Mawé are ready to endure any coming storm."

Marriages in the tribe are restricted to between the two groups and not within them.Their religion is one of shamanic cosmology and they believe in a divine relationship with all things living and nonliving with the Cosmos.  The Munduruku custom of warfare is related to the practice of taking their enemies heads as trophies, which are then embalmed and thought to possess magical properties that appease the Munduruku’s “Mother of the Hunt'' in hopes of being blessed with good game. Because of this behavior, some of their neighboring tribes refer to them as the “red ants”."

 deni_tribe_desc:0 "The Deni, also known as the Jamamadi-Deni or Madihá-Deni, are a people situated between the Xeruã River and Cuniuá River. Victims of the rubber boom, much of the Deni found themselves in chains and forced to work on plantations during the 1940s. The Deni tribes also suffered greatly from their first contact with the white explorers; the diseases brought to the Deni decimated the population which led to the disorganization of the people and caused a crisis amongst the Deni tribes. The Deni people are expert hunters and fishermen, relying mainly on game as their main food source. In the Deni religion, it is believed that the shaman’s can speak to the spirits and the deceased to determine causes of death. Today, the Deni remain much more vulnerable from the outside world. From merchants looking to profiteer, tycoons prospecting for resources, and slavers searching for merchandise, the worst for the Deni has yet to come."

 tappers_desc:0 "The 3rd Rubber Boom brought life once again to the Amazon, with immigrants from around Brazil settling in the dense jungle trying to make their fortune from the rich Rubber trade, this sudden influx of people however is a major disruption in the delicate ecosystem of the Amazon rainforest and its native people, undisturbed for millions of years. Without government regulations and motivated by the promise of fortune these tappers, loggers and gold diggers plunder and destroy in search of their promised wealth bringing much harm to the Amazon’s native residents."
 fonte_boa_influence_desc:0 "Native life is a communal one, tribes live in close family bonds where all is shared amongst residents, from food gathered during hunts to weapons, tools, houses and in some cases even wifes. Cooperation is what kept these people alive and prospering for hundreds of years, it is no surprise that this way of living would fit so well with Marxist ideals, and that the naive natives would be slowly influenced by them as contact and cooperation with the former §RAraguaia Guerrilla§! fighters increases, while they may not fully understand the scope of the revolution or the concept of bourgeoisie and class struggle the gifts of firearms, medicine and modernization brought by the rebels is enough to turn these naive people into warriors for the revolution."

 waimiri_atroari_desc:0 "The Waimiri and Atroari share close bonds, so close as to being considered one single tribe by some researchers, what unites them the most however is the hatred for the white invaders that rape their land from it’s riches. This small confederation of natives stands as a formidable force to lone explorers and settlers trying to make a living in the northern Amazon, being known for their ferocity and sometimes extreme brutality."
 staunch_isolationists_desc:0 "Contact with the white man is not always welcomed with open arms, although it can bring improvements to the native’s way of living being “civilized” normally only brings suffering to the tribes, who are branded as second class citizens, exploited by being forced to work exhausting jobs for minimal pay and ultimately destroying their traditional way of living.
