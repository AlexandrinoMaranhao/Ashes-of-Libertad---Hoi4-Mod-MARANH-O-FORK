 the_white_linned_mayor_desc:0 "Despite its recent despair Coari was blessed for decades with the presence of §YAlexandre Montoril§!, it's years long well mannered and dressed mayor. In the face of oblivion and abandonment, this thin old man's sheer force of will may be all that separates Coari from its near obvious fate."

 coari_desperation_desc:0 "When the army was recalled in '65 they pillaged the city to its bare bones and without relief from the Brazilian government it's citizens have been forced to survive with little to nothing, nowadays it is common to see people fighting for clothes or medicine on the streets or depend entirely on the church and the jungle for food and water."

 the_red_menace_desc:0 "Bolívia, Acre's arch-nemesis (if we ignore all the others), a ever present Menace to Acre's young sovereignty and it's people, the fear of another invasion by the Northern Revolutionary Army both paralyzes and readies the nation to another round of fighting. We can only hope we can once again best the might of Ce Guevara."
 the_cabanos_desc:0 "When Filinto Müller and the AMC purged the Araguaia river from its guerrilla the battered survivors fled north through the amazon’s rich river system, spreading like fire in dry grass. Although they are disorganized and demoralized they keep being a problem, a constant reminder of the dangers of communism."
 the_juntas_favorite_pet_desc:0 "Pará is a rare example of competence within the Brazilian Military Junta, even with its problems the state continues to function with remarkable loyalty and efficiency, and it is rewarded greatly by doing it, like the proud owner of a beautiful dog the Junta answers to Pará’s every desire as long as it keeps proving itself a capable, useful ally."
 the_siege_of_altamira_desc:0 "Details are hazy, news are rare, all that is known is that a so far unknown military force has sieged and blockaded the far western town of Altamira, in the edge of Pará’s stable control area. As the state mobilizes a relief force and tries it’s best to reestablish communications all in Belém pray silently for the safety of their friends and family surrounded beyond the Xingu."
 overcrowded_island_desc:0 "After the collapse of the AMC the scattered troops regrouped on the last place still under their direct control, the river island town of Nhamundá. \nThe sudden influx of men turned living in the island into a §Rnightmare§! for citizens and soldiers alike, making everyday life unbearable as the streets are flooded with hungry, homeless, belligerent men."
 the_amazonian_military_command_desc:0 "Created in 1956 by General Rodrigo Octávio Jordão, the §GAmazonian Military Command§! was created with the ambitious dream of being the best jungle fighting military unit in the world. \nIt’s area of operations includes the states of Amazonas, Roraima, Rondônia and Acre as well as the 12th Military Region.\nComposed by native americans and military personnel from other Military Commands it is, despite its recent downfall, a formidable fighting force that might as well have already accomplished its dream goal."
 what_are_we_fighting_for_desc:0 "The decision to keep itself neutral in the ongoing conflict in Brazil at first looked like a smart decision, a way to keep the conflict away from the jungle and its people. \nIt, however, led to the AMC being drained of resources by both the Republic and Junta in an effort to keep itself in good terms with both leading to infighting between soldiers and officers loyal to each party. \nUltimately, these were the cracks that broke the Amazonian Military Command."

 tappers_desc:0 "The 3rd Rubber Boom brought life once again to the Amazon, with immigrants from around Brazil settling in the dense jungle trying to make their fortune from the rich Rubber trade, this sudden influx of people however is a major disruption in the delicate ecosystem of the Amazon rainforest and its native people, undisturbed for millions of years. Without government regulations and motivated by the promise of fortune these tappers, loggers and gold diggers plunder and destroy in search of their promised wealth bringing much harm to the Amazon’s native residents."
 fonte_boa_influence_desc:0 "Native life is a communal one, tribes live in close family bonds where all is shared amongst residents, from food gathered during hunts to weapons, tools, houses and in some cases even wifes. Cooperation is what kept these people alive and prospering for hundreds of years, it is no surprise that this way of living would fit so well with Marxist ideals, that the naive natives are slowly influenced by as contact and cooperation with the former Araguaia guerrilla fighters increases, while they may not fully understand the scope of the revolution or the concept of bourgeoisie and class struggle the gifts of firearms, medicine and modernization brought by the rebels is enough to turn these naive people into warriors for the revolution."
 displaced_tribe_desc:0 "Tribal wars and the White man sometimes results in a tribe getting displaced from its ancestral home, being forced to leave behind it’s sacred places, hunting grounds and having to change its way of living in order to survive, while the fate of such tribes is unknown one thing is always certain, the will to return home always lives strong in these people’s hearts."
 waimiri_atroari_desc:0 "The Waimiri and Atroari share close bonds, so close as to being considered one single tribe by some researchers, what unites them the most however is the hatred for the white invaders that rape their land from it’s riches. This small confederation of natives stands as a formidable force to lone explorers and settlers trying to make a living in the northern Amazon, being known for their ferocity and sometimes extreme brutality."
 staunch_isolationists_desc:0 "Contact with the white man is not always welcomed with open arms, although it can bring improvements to the native’s way of living being “civilized” normally only brings suffering to the tribes, who are branded as second class citizens, exploited by being forced to work exhausting jobs for minimal pay and ultimately destroying their traditional way of living. Be it for these reasons or a simple disliking and untrusting of the white man some tribes wish to remain isolated and will fight to protect its own interests."
 uncontacted_desc:0 "The Amazon is full of mysteries, and events as big as the Nuclear Apocalypse are unnoticed by some of its more secluded residents, in the deep jungles there are still communities of people who are unaware of the existence of the white man or any of its struggles."
 unnexplored_land_desc:0 "The exploration efforts of the Amazon done in the late 19th and early 20th century came to an abrupt end with the outbreak of Nuclear and Civil war, exploration efforts are largely ignored by every major state, them being distracted with bigger problems, and much of what was already known was lost as academics died out or stopped performing their activities and maps or documents got lost in the flames of war, leaving much of the Amazon a mystery."
 civilized_desc:0 "Not all natives rejected the white man, either forcibly or by their own will they adopted the white man’s ways and abandoned their old ones, although it varies from place to place these people are in theory Brazilian citizens with all the rights that come with it, being largely catholic and portuguese speaking. However, with the cultural change many came to live in poverty when compared to Western standards and are exploited and treated as second class citizens."
 tribal_wars_desc:0 "Unbeknownst to the white man and the greater Brazilian state the isolated tribes of the Amazon regularly partake in tribal warfare, some going as far as to consider this as a fundamental part of their cultural identity. Although these conflicts have few casualties due to the lack of technology of the tribes they sometimes end in the death of experienced warriors or influential tribe members, destruction of precious resources or forced displacement of the losing tribe."
 military_oppression_desc:0 "In these troubling times order has become a priority to militaries in all sides of the conflict, and many tribes became targets under the sights of the jackboot, minor violations receive disproportionately large punishments, military brutality is rampant and tribal life is abruptly forced to end, dismantled and dismembered by the army in an effort to keep peace at all costs."
 loggers_desc:0 "The 11th Parallel Massacre was an act of indescribable and unpunished evil and violence, in 1963 the Rubber extracting firm Arruda, Junqueira & Co organized, payed and executed the largest massacre in an ongoing genocide of Native Americans. While attempting to remove a settlement of natives of the Cinta Larga ethnicity in the headwaters of the Aripuanã river dynamite was dropped off a monoplane into the village before it being invaded by machine gun armed mercenaries, of the more than 3500 people living there only 2 escaped with their lives, amongst the atrocities committed there was the mutilation and exposing of bodies as a warning to other native communities, no punishment came to Arruda, Junqueira & Co from the government, who some say sponsored and keep on sponsoring the ongoing genocide.\n\n§RThis is a footnote in the history of the native’s suffering.§!"
 native_white_cooperation_desc:0 "As the central government collapsed many riverside communities came to depend on the land to survive, to do so new ties were formed with the natives that dwell deeper in the jungle, in a symbiotic self-sustaining relationship allowing both parties to coexist in relative peace without the presence of the Brazilian government."
 neblina_exploited_desc:0 "The Neblina are not just guns for hire at Manaus’s disposal, they are a nightmare for anyone in their reach. Incapable of sustaining their own they pillage and exploit those near to them, demanding tribute or outright sacking, pillaging and massacring entire communities in search of supplies and able-bodied men to sell in the Manauan Market as ‘’Servants’’."
