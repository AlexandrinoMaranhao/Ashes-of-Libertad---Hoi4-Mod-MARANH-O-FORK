In the face of oblivion and abandonment, this thin old man's sheer force of will may be all that separates Coari from its near obvious fate."

coari_desperation_desc:0 "When the army was recalled in '65 they pillaged the city to its bare bones and without relief from the Brazilian government it's citizens have been forced to survive with little to nothing, nowadays it is common to see people fighting for clothes or medicine on the streets or depend entirely on the church and the jungle for food and water."

the_red_menace_desc:0 "Bolívia, Acre's arch-nemesis (if we ignore all the others), a ever present Menace to Acre's young sovereignty and it's people, the fear of another invasion by the Northern Revolutionary Army both paralyzes and readies the nation to another round of fighting. We can only hope we can once again best the might of Ce Guevara."
the_cabanos_desc:0 "When Filinto Müller and the AMC purged the Araguaia river from its guerrilla the battered survivors fled north through the amazon’s rich river system, spreading like fire in dry grass. Although they are disorganized and demoralized they keep being a problem, a constant reminder of the dangers of communism."
the_juntas_favorite_pet_desc:0 "Pará is a rare example of competence within the Brazilian Military Junta, even with its problems the state continues to function with remarkable loyalty and efficiency, and it is rewarded greatly by doing it, like the proud owner of a beautiful dog the Junta answers to Pará’s every desire as long as it keeps proving itself a capable, useful ally."
the_siege_of_altamira_desc:0 "Details are hazy, news are rare, all that is known is that a so far unknown military force has sieged and blockaded the far western town of Altamira, in the edge of Pará’s stable control area. As the state mobilizes a relief force and tries it’s best to reestablish communications all in Belém pray silently for the safety of their friends and family surrounded beyond the Xingu."
overcrowded_island_desc:0 "After the collapse of the AMC the scattered troops regrouped on the last place still under their direct control, the river island town of Nhamundá. \nThe sudden influx of men turned living in the island into a §Rnightmare§! for citizens and soldiers alike, making everyday life unbearable as the streets are flooded with hungry, homeless, belligerent men."
the_amazonian_military_command_desc:0 "Created in 1956 by General Rodrigo Octávio Jordão, the §GAmazonian Military Command§! was created with the ambitious dream of being the best jungle fighting military unit in the world. \nIt’s area of operations includes the states of Amazonas, Roraima, Rondônia and Acre as well as the 12th Military Region.\nComposed by native americans and military personnel from other Military Commands it is, despite its recent downfall, a formidable fighting force that might as well have already accomplished its dream goal."
what_are_we_fighting_for_desc:0 "The decision to keep itself neutral in the ongoing conflict in Brazil at first looked like a smart decision, a way to keep the conflict away from the jungle and its people. \nIt, however, led to the AMC being drained of resources by both the Republic and Junta in an effort to keep itself in good terms with both leading to infighting between soldiers and officers loyal to each party. \nUltimately, these were the cracks that broke the Amazonian Military Command."
