world.1.t:0 "The Return of Carlos Prestes"
world.1.d:0 "Surprising news coming from the Brazilian northeast as historic revolutionary Luis Carlos Prestes is reported to have returned to the public and political life, having publicly announced his comeback on April 23rd, 1969, the 27th anniversary of the death of his late wife Olga Benário, executed in Germany after being deported during the Vargas regime. Once the most influential symbol of the Brazilian far-left Prestes disappeared from the public eye after being expelled from the PCB over conflicting opinions on armed struggle, on Preste’s returning speech, transmitted on a radio station reportedly operated by the ALN, he emphasized his personal abandonment of the concept of revolution through peace that he once defended and called for the divided worker parties of Brazil to rise together on what has been dubbed a “Second Intentona Comunista”."

world.35.t:0 "The Return of Carlos Prestes"
world.35.d:0 "News of his return has been received with shock by authorities and revolutionaries alike many of who believed his years-long silence to be a sign of his death, capture, or self-exile; nonetheless, it heavily impacted the Brazilian communist sphere sparking a tirade of retributory and retaliatory speeches and demonstrations from leaderships on both sides, most notably the increasingly daring actions of dissidents in the states of São Paulo, Bahia, and Pernambuco. Prestes’s location and previous or current associations are so far unknown but it is expected that he has renewed ties with revolutionary leaderships from across the country and beyond, concrete reactions from both sides of the political spectrum remain to be seen."

world.2.t:0 "The Second Mexican-American War"
world.2.d:0 "After almost a decade of facing a constant stream of American refugees crossing the Rio Grande every single day, it would seem that the entire country has decided to move to Mexico, quite literally. Gathering stories, it would appear the United States has been suffering from a worsening nuclear winter that has rendered life unsustainable in the country. Now, remnants from the United States Army seem to have gathered every little resource they could scrape together and launched a desperate attempt at survival by invading the weary Mexican State. As columns of armored vehicles and air cavalry descend upon the southern neighbor in droves, it would appear that both nations, or what remains of them, find themselves once more in a state of war against the other."
