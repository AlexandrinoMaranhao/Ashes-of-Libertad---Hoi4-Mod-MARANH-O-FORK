world.1.t:0 "The Return of Carlos Prestes"
world.1.d:0 "Surprising news coming from the Brazilian northeast as historic revolutionary Luis Carlos Prestes is reported to have returned to the public and political life, having publicly announced his comeback on April 23rd, 1969, the 27th anniversary of the death of his late wife Olga Benário, executed in Germany after being deported during the Vargas regime. Once the most influential symbol of the Brazilian far-left Prestes disappeared from the public eye after being expelled from the PCB over conflicting opinions on armed struggle, on Preste’s returning speech, transmitted on a radio station reportedly operated by the ALN, he emphasized his personal abandonment of the concept of revolution through peace that he once defended and called for the divided worker parties of Brazil to rise together on what has been dubbed a “Second Intentona Comunista”."

world.35.t:0 "The Return of Carlos Prestes"
world.35.d:0 "News of his return has been received with shock by authorities and revolutionaries alike many of who believed his years-long silence to be a sign of his death, capture, or self-exile; nonetheless, it heavily impacted the Brazilian communist sphere sparking a tirade of retributory and retaliatory speeches and demonstrations from leaderships on both sides, most notably the increasingly daring actions of dissidents in the states of São Paulo, Bahia, and Pernambuco. Prestes’s location and previous or current associations are so far unknown but it is expected that he has renewed ties with revolutionary leaderships from across the country and beyond, concrete reactions from both sides of the political spectrum remain to be seen."

world.2.t:0 "The Second Mexican-American War"
world.2.d:0 "The Second Mexican-American War Mexico had become a bit of an El-Dorado for the American people, fleeing as fast as possible from the ravaging nuclear horrors that exist beyond the Rio Grande. Despite the attempts by Mexico to handle the refugee stream, an announcement had been made from the usually very quiet United States Government - at least what are believed to be its remnants in the mainland. Considering Americans have been in a profound state of horror ever since the bombings of 1962, it's been clear that an inevitable conflict would occur - but nothing in this scale could ever have been envisioned: As millions of American citizens run towards newly-gained territory against Mexico, some desperate enough to run right into the frontlines and try their luck at staying alive, the hungry and sick soldiers of the United States have begun invading Mexico with ravaging resolve."

world.3.t:0 "The Second Battle of Guanabara"
world.3.d:0 "The Fluminenses woke up today to the sounds of gunfire in the streets, as the Eastern Military Command started their second advance on Rio de Janeiro. The first battle in ‘63, at the beginning of the civil war, was a major success for the Legalists, driving the EMC out of Rio de Janeiro and forcing them to retreat to the gates of Vitória. After their defeat, the Brazilians took their time to greatly fortify entire city as they slowly were pushed backward, every block in the city of God is prepared for the inevitable counter-attack. Many doubt if the Legalists can hold on to the city, given what they describe as the “Precarious state of the administrative and military sectors” and “Lack of leadership present in Rio”, made worse by the recent defection of the Southeastern Military Command and the State of São Paulo, the same however can be said of their foe."

world.45.t:0 "The Second Battle of Guanabara"
world.45.d:0 "For the last years, Rio has been plagued with a constant barrage of refugees pushed south by the impending Junta forces and coastal and aerial bombardments targeting the Legalist’s makeshift and pre-war fortifications, such as the Copacabana, São João, and Duque de Caxias Fortresses. Admiral Rademaker (De Facto leader of the EMC’s military) did not spare the wonderful city from the awe of war, the 2nd Battle of Guanabara will forever be remembered as a turning point in the Brazilian Civil war marking the moment when a dragging and “indifferent” war characterized by chaotic skirmishes with low fatalities climaxed into modern warfare the likes of which were last seen in the Second World War. Brazil and Christ both wait in horror to see who’ll be the winner of this irredeemable fratricide."

world.4.t:0 "Legalists hold on to Rio de Janeiro!"
world.4.d:0 "After months of gruesome warfare and street-to-street struggle, the fighting in Rio de Janeiro has come to an end as forces from the Brazilian Junta abruptly ceased after what is now considered a final, desperate push. While both sides lay exhausted the Legalist forces have managed to hold on to the City of God against all odds, a much-needed breath of relief for Goulart’s supporters. Although the fighting has stopped reconstruction efforts are not expected to happen shortly as Admiral Rademaker’s navy continues to bombard the now ruins of Rio, it seems that for the foreseeable future many of Rio’s inhabitants will be forced to leave or live among the ruins of a once wonderful city."
world.4.a:0 "The not so wonderful city."

world.5.t:0 "Guanabara overrun by the E.M.C.!"
world.5.d:0 "The Guanabara Palace, once a proud relic and symbol of Brazilian culture from the neoclassical era, has been overrun by the Eastern Military Command marking the end of the 2nd Battle of Guanabara. The remaining Legalist forces scatter to the south passing through São Paulo and the Serra do Mar or gather in the refugee slums to form partisan groups or merge with the population, abandoning the war altogether. Although the Legalits defended to the brink of their teeth, the EMC, using decisive coordinated moves with their army and navy, outmatched the barely supplied Legalits and their low numbers. In Rio and Niterói, rallies sympathizing with the EMC floods the bombed-out streets as if Carnaval had come back to the city after years, it is unknown if the Legalits will ever recover their strength and makeup from the losses in the effort to retake the City of God."

world.46.d:0 "In a tragic and mysterious crash during a flight to the state of Ceará, the President of the Brazilian Military Junta, Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco, has passed away. His remains, charred by what is speculated to have been an explosion, have been recovered and sent back to Brasília. The Junta, incapacitated by his sudden death, has declared a three-day period of mourning - the capital has been turned into a de facto demilitarized zone, with the army having retreated into the provinces and often into thin air altogether. The world has responded in a myriad of different ways. Many reacted with plain shock, the strongman's larger-than-life persona having seemed an indomitable force, and his absence bringing great uncertainty to the geopolitical landscape of Brazil."

world.47.t:0 "Castelo Branco Dies in Plane Accident!"
world.47.d:0 "Many grieved his death, with regime members and their supporters amongst the people honoring and praising him for bringing stability and peace to the region, albeit through authoritarian means. Others still rejoiced at the tyrant's downfall, hosting street parties and private celebrations - it is certain that Florianopólis was filled with cheer, if only for one day, for example. No matter one's views towards Castelo Branco, it is indisputable that he was one of the most powerful men in Brazil. With his demise, the Junta's elite circle seems to have fallen into chaos, and its leaders have called for an emergency voting session. Despite the dictator's premature passing, the Junta, albeit weakened, remains nowhere close to collapse."
world.47.a:0 "A huge blow to the Junta."

world.48.t:0 "Quatro Povos Das Missões Defeats Coari!"
world.48.d:0 "One of the most surprising turns of the tricky Amazonian jungle is the undoubted victory of the Mission's forces against the Coari municipal Government, which believed that a quick war with Tefé municipality, under Mission protection, would help with several of their issues regarding resources. However, it has become painfully clear that the war was a disaster - not only Coari was defeated in the frontlines, but its government utterly collapsed, and Mission soldiers are entering the city to establish a new satellite state of the Missions. The government, having nowhere to run, was arrested and the Mayor publicly executed for his crimes against the victims of his piracy."

world.49.t:0 "''The Rape of Tefé!''"
world.49.d:0 "With the luck of bandits, the Municipality of Coari has managed to seize another city-state, once under protection of the Quatro Povos das Missões, named Tefé. The small city, largely a Christian theocracy just like the Missions, had been the staging ground of a proxy war between Coari and the Missions, helping further deliminate Coari's influence in the area. The war, successful and quick, is sure to be a boon to the Coarense people."

world_acr.1.d:0 "With the signing of the Acrean Constitution, nearly two dozen of the Senate's previously empty seats have been filled and with it, a vote within the chamber has been held to elect the nation's first president, Edgar Cerqueira, one of the heads of the Militarist Party. The victor is Edgar Cerqueira, one of the nation's most prominent militarists and a former army commander. Extremely critical of communism and the Technocratic faction, who Cerqueira has decried as socialist sympathizers, the strongman has called for major military buildup and the formation of a professional Acrean army to fend off raids and destroy the ERN. Edgar is also seemingly more friendly to the Brazilian Military Junta than the other candidates, leading to fears amongst opposition members that he will sell out the Republic to Brasília - claims that the new President has fiercely denied."

De Souza's base of support mainly comprises the rural workers and rubber tappers of the Republic, with his promises of enacting sweeping reforms to protect labor rights and large-scale social programs having appealed to the lower classes. The most well-known of his proposals include a national public healthcare system, as well as increased funding to schools. He has also made a name for himself by supporting a peaceful solution to the conflict of Che Guevara rather than war against Guevara's brigades, the ERN, leading him to be called a communist by the most extreme members of the opposition."

Despite how the word nationalist might conjure up thoughts of ethnic supremacists, imperialists, and conquerors, Cury is far from being described by any of those terms. Cury's nationalism is the belief in the independence of Acre as a free and democratic state, and the preservation of such as opposed to reintegration with Brazil.\nCury has promised economic reforms and holds an especially high level of support amongst the indigenous people, whose rights he has argued for consistently. In terms of foreign policy, Cury is supportive of a more diplomatic and peaceful approach to neighboring statelets."
