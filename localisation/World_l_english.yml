world.2.d:0 "After almost a decade of facing a constant stream of American refugees crossing the Rio Grande every single day, it would seem that the entire country has decided to move to Mexico, quite literally. Gathering stories, it would appear the United States has been suffering from a worsening nuclear winter that has rendered life unsustainable in the country. Now, remnants from the United States Army seem to have gathered every little resource they could scrape together and launched a desperate attempt at survival by invading the weary Mexican State. As columns of armored vehicles and air cavalry descend upon the southern neighbor in droves, it would appear that both nations, or what remains of them, find themselves once more in a state of war against the other."
