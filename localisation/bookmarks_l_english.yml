 BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "How did we get here?"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Brazilian giant lies exhausted and defeated by itself, years of fighting turned the once green fields and prosperous cities of the southeast into grey featureless rubble and from it new players arise to challenge the old republic and the greater state for the right to rule Brazil."
 BRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Second Brazilian Republic is broken, but not yet dead. Luck had never been on their side since the beginning of the civil war that shattered Brazil, support for President Goulart grows weaker by the day as the elections are postponed again and again, and after the betrayal of São Paulo makes so democracy seems more of a lost cause then ever before, in the backstage new and old characters draft their own plans and solutions to save Brazil in their own way, even if they have to put out the republican fire in order to build a new Brazil."
 JUN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Junta is barely a country, held together by the pretense of saviors of Brazil against the Red Menace and the iron grip of the army, the unorganized and chaotic coup being largely responsible for the continuous loses of the army against much weaker revolts and the constant infighting between members of the military, it's mismanagement caused large chunks of the country to fall into anarchy and into the hands of warlords, colonels and any kind of local authority unless directly occupied by the army, so much for saviors."
 UBA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "A subdivision of the Greater Military Junta that operates almost independently under the guidance of General Hugo De Andrade Abreu, a WW2 veteran turned public figure as a propaganda effort to increase popular support of the Junta, the 36° Battalion is now a household name being known nationally as Brazil's finest warriors, having held off the Miner's Revolt for months and secured the Mineiro Triangle, a region of huge strategic and economic importance, but time, money and fame can change anyone and the stoic figure of Abreu is quickly starting to fade under the promise of wealth far beyond what the Junta can give him."
 CRJ_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Pushed out of Minas Gerais by the reds, having it's supply lines with Brasília cut and having lost the First Battle of Guanabara, the Eastern Military command is battered, undersupplied and most importantly, humiliated, it's only respect worthy asset being the Navy, possibly the mightiest in the Americas and led by Admiral Augusto Rademaker, de facto leader of the Eastern Military command given the state of it's ground forces, it falls to his hands the responsibility of making this chapter of the Junta fight worthy again and take back what they lost, or desert from it and make something new like many sailors have done before."
