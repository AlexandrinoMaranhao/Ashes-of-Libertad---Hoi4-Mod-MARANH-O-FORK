 ROR_ONOFRE_DESC:0 "Born in the south of the state of São Paulo, Onofre worked as a mechanic and accountant before joining the army, reaching the rank of sargent until his political rights were revoked by the Institutional Act n°1 in 1962, Onofre then joined the MNR, a guerrilla in the south of Brazil and the Araguaia Guerrilla after the breakup of the former. Along with Carlos Lamarca and many others Onofre took part in the migration north to the amazon fleeing from Araguaia after the Junta noticed their existence and ''dissolved'' the movement, leaving dead comrades and old ideals of libertarian Marxism behind as the reality of war scared his view of the world beyond recognition. His stay at Fonte Boa was brief, he shortly left for Vista Boa where his partnership with Wilson began and his carisma mixed with Onofre's military and guerrilla experience where able to turn the 12a Divisão de Infantaria do Norte (12° Northern Division of Infantry), the Misfits, against the Junta and convinced them to join the revolution."
 ROR_WILSON_DESC:0 "Born in 1933 in Amazonas, Wilson Souza de Pinheiro grew up in a poor, but happy family. During the 60s with the fall of rubber prices in Brazil him and his fellow rubber tappers found themselves employed and exploited by many rich land owners, and facing this situation, Wilson began advocating for worker's rights in Acre, where he worked at. After WW3 and the following civil war in Brazil, Wilson was contacted by Guevarist officials and told to hold an armed insurgency in the state of Acre; this revolt failed horribly, and faced with possible execution Souza fled north to Roraima and by chance met with Onofre Pinto and together made a new revolution, the Roraima Worker's Front. Upon his arrival, Wilson was quickly chosen as a their leader due to his rallying charisma and reputation. Now he must face the struggles of not only leading a country, but uniting the hungry populace and warry militants."
