BEM_the_new_problem_desc:0 "In the mouth of the Xingu River sits Altamira, Belém’s fortress city against river threats coming from down south, in the last weeks however communication and supply lines are being blocked and driven away by a so far unknown military force, so far the conflict has been not more than a bloodless standoff, let’s pray we can keep it that way until a solution arrives."
BEM_the_older_problem_desc:0 "Older than the Cabanos or mercenaries of Santarém, Pará is home to a much, much older problem, the natives, the vast jungles and marches are home to entire civilizations who have lived mostly ignorant of the events away from the small stretch of land they call home, treating the white man and it’s ways with equal curiosity and fear, one of them however has proved themselves brave enough to fight back, the Kayapó, and they must be dealt with."
BEM_the_old_problem_desc:0 "The Cabanos, a name used before to describe the members of one of the many Regencial Revolts of the 1800’s now reused to describe the enemies of the modern Paraense State, a generic way to describe hostile natives, republican loyalist forces and communist guerrillas fleeing from the crushed Araguaia Guerrilla, they must be crushed again, and quick."
