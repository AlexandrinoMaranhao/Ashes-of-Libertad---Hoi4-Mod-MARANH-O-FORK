THIRD_BATTLE_OF_GUANABARA.1.d:0 "In the morning hours of today, forces of the so-called ''2nd Constitutionalist Revolution'' have entered Rio de Janeiro, throwing the Wonderful City into open warfare once more. The Brazilian state of São Paulo had declared its neutrality in the ongoing civil war that ravages the country in early 1962, declaring unconstitutional both the Brasília and Rio-based governments. weakened by the civil war both parties found themselves incapable to retake control of the state, limiting their actions to an embargo with the goal of starving the state into submission and radicalizing the population in their favor. This proved to be a blunder as the Revolution rapidly armed itself under the command of General João Figueiredo and now seems to enter the ring as a capable contender for the reigns of Brazil. The outcome is still to be seen, for now, we pray for Rio."

world.1.d:0 "Surprising news coming from the Brazilian northeast as historic revolutionary Luis Carlos Prestes is reported to have returned to the public and political life, having publicly announced his comeback on April 23rd, 1971, the 29th anniversary of the death of his late wife Olga Benário, executed in Germany after being deported during the Vargas regime. Once the most influential symbol of the Brazilian far-left Prestes disappeared from the public eye after being expelled from the PCB over conflicting opinions on armed struggle, on Preste’s returning speech, transmitted on a radio station reportedly operated by the ALN, he emphasized his personal abandonment of the concept of revolution through peace that he once defended and called for the divided worker parties of Brazil to rise together on what has been dubbed a ''Second Intentona Comunista''."

world.2.d:0 "Absolute chaos has enthralled the Rio Grande as millions of American refugees cross the border by force, making their way into the Mexican heartland. Many independent groups of American refugees have been fleeing the corpse of the USA ever since the devastating bombings of 1962, but recent events suggest that numbers never before seen are about to descend on the already struggling Mexican republic, signaling societal collapse. The action has been compared to a form of Manifest Destiny driven by hunger and desperation, and although seemingly anarchic military clashes in the border indicates some form of loose organization between the millions of invading civilians, presumably orquestrated by what little remains of the Pre-War American government with the objective of propelling a relocation and resettling effort comparable to the barbarian invasions of Roman times."

world.3.d:0 "The Fluminenses woke up today to the sounds of gunfire in the streets, as the Eastern Military Command started their second advance on Rio de Janeiro. The first battle in ‘63, at the beginning of the civil war, was a major success for the Legalists, driving the EMC out of Rio de Janeiro and forcing them to retreat to the gates of Vitória. After their defeat, the Brazilians took their time to greatly fortify entire city as they slowly were pushed backward, every block in the city of God is prepared for the inevitable counter-attack. Many doubt if the Legalists can hold on to the city, given what they describe as the ''Precarious state of the administrative and military sectors'' and ''Lack of leadership present in Rio'', made worse by the recent defection of the Southeastern Military Command and the State of São Paulo, the same however can be said of their foe."

While both sides lay exhausted the Legalist forces have managed to hold on to the City of God against all odds, a much-needed breath of relief for Goulart’s supporters and a blow to Castelo Branco's junta's moral. Although the fighting has stopped reconstruction efforts are not expected to happen shortly as Admiral Rademaker’s navy continues to bombard the now ruins of Rio, it seems that for the foreseeable future many of its inhabitants will be forced to leave or live among the ruins of a once wonderful city or literally run to the hills in makeshift communities under the watch of the Republican army."

The remaining Legalist forces are scattering south passing through São Paulo and the Serra do Mar or gathering in refugee slums to form partisan groups or merge with the population, abandoning the war altogether. Although the Legalists defended Rio de Janeiro to the brink of their teeth, the E.M.C., using decisive coordinated moves with their army and navy, outmatched the Republicans. In Rio and Niterói, rallies in support of the Junta flood the bombed-out streets as if Carnaval had returned to the city after years, it is unknown if the Legalists will ever recover their strength and makeup from their losses in their efforts to hold on to the City of God."

Worse even is the exoteric nature of their message. The Unión announced its unification along with the augury of the ''Second coming of Viracocha'', an apparent reinterpretation of the historical figure of Pizzaro, believed to return to save the worthy from the apocalypse."

However, their goals of bringing peace and equality back to these lands are still far from achieved, as now more than ever before it becomes clear that the Tawantinsuyu are only united due to their strong ethnic and historical ties and common struggler against foreign intruders and threats."

Despite this, his political victory seems to be based on sheer nostalgia, as he has presented no plan for victory in the ongoing Civil War besides flaming speeches promising ''500 years in 5'', a substantial upgrade of his classic slogan.

Now in power, Lott has declared himself to be the President while being a Marechal at the same time. In the same note, he came down hard on the Junta, saying to their former colleagues that it is “Completely antidemocratic and contrary to the national interests of deposing a president of the republic while in the middle of reconstruction after total nuclear war.”, and “Constitucional freedom must be maintained in the country at any cost!”.

While introducing more social plans to the state, he had been accused of getting votes from the Communist Party of Brazil, in which he stated “Laborism is nationalist, Communism is international; Communism is materialist, Laborism is inspired by the social christian doctrine.”.

From there he would beat his political rival Francisco Antonio millionaire campaign as Mayor of São Paulo with almost no funds, and voted in for Governor of São Paulo afterwards, winning his opponents by just 1%, then running for presidency with 5,6 million votes, the highest vote obtained in Brazil. Now in charge, his first act was to incorporate São Paulo back to the Republic, which they accepted with open arms. Although they are part of it now, Jânio must be very careful on how to move ahead, since past relations are making difficult challenges on what the republic is willing to accept from São Paulo and its own people.

The world has responded in a myriad of different ways.

The small riverside city, reorganized under the local Christian authorities after the collapse of the Federal Government, had managed to make itself a prosperous center of trade in the region. That came to an end when it became the staging ground of a proxy war between Coari and the QPM, helping further deliminate Coari's influence in the area. The sheer isolation of the battleground makes it difficult to pinpoint the motivations of such a barbaric act or the exact nature of the war, nonetheless, is sure to be a boon to the Coarense people."

The amalgam of accounts about him seem to paint a bloody picture worthy of adventure books, which are backed by rumors of 'Comandante' Lamarca's recent attempts to contact hiding veterans of the dismembered Communist Party and failed Araguaia Guerrilla in an effort to consolidate what he calls the ''Fundação Libertadora do Índio'', or FULAI, a marxist-indigenist oriented Guerrilla force. If any of this is true it is still to be confirmed, as no contact attempt has yet been made."

Ever since before the Nuclear War tensions ran high between the two countries as thousands of El Salvadorian citizens immigrated to Honduras as a result of the overpopulation of the tiny Central American nation, only aggravated with the arrival of American refugees fleeing from the nuclear hellscape of the former USA. The complete collapse of the ''Banana Republic'' system of government accompanied by the growing number of expatriates has led to crippling famine and vexation in the fledgling nations, whose citizens turned to violence when faced with misery and starvation. The armed clash came as an answer to an outburst of persecution of El Salvadorians and people of other nationalities in Honduras, possibly following a football match that ended in a riot by the losing side."
