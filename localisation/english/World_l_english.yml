world.1.t:0 "The Return of Carlos Prestes"
world.1.d:0 "Surprising news coming from the Brazilian northeast as historic revolutionary Luis Carlos Prestes is reported to have returned to the public and political life, having publicly announced his comeback on April 23rd, 1969, the 27th anniversary of the death of his late wife Olga Benário, executed in Germany after being deported during the Vargas regime. Once the most influential symbol of the Brazilian far-left Prestes disappeared from the public eye after being expelled from the PCB over conflicting opinions on armed struggle, on Preste’s returning speech, transmitted on a radio station reportedly operated by the ALN, he emphasized his personal abandonment of the concept of revolution through peace that he once defended and called for the divided worker parties of Brazil to rise together on what has been dubbed a ''Second Intentona Comunista''."

world.35.d:0 "News of his return has been received with shock by authorities and revolutionaries alike many of who believed his years-long silence to be evidence of his death, capture, or self-exile; nonetheless, it heavily impacted the Brazilian communist sphere sparking a tirade of retributory speeches and demonstrations from leaderships on both sides, most notably the increasingly daring actions of dissidents in the states of São Paulo, Bahia, and Pernambuco from groups like the ALN, COLINA and the Peasant Leagues. Prestes’s location and previous or current associations are so far unknown but it is expected that he has renewed ties with revolutionary leaderships from across the country and beyond, concrete reactions from both sides of the political spectrum remain to be seen but retaliatory actions from both governments are to be expected in the coming months."

world.2.d:0 "The Second Mexican-American War Mexico had become a bit of an El-Dorado for the American people, fleeing as fast as possible from the ravaging nuclear horrors that exist beyond the Rio Grande. Despite the attempts by Mexico to handle the refugee stream, an announcement had been made from the usually very quiet United States Government - at least what are believed to be its remnants in the mainland. Considering Americans have been in a profound state of horror ever since the bombings of 1962, it's been clear that an inevitable conflict would occur - but nothing in this scale could ever have been envisioned: As millions of American citizens run towards newly-gained territory against Mexico, some desperate enough to run right into the frontlines and try their luck at staying alive, the hungry and sick soldiers of the United States invade Mexico with ravaging resolve."

The first battle in ‘63, at the beginning of the civil war, was a major success for the Legalists, driving the EMC out of Rio de Janeiro and forcing them to retreat to the gates of Vitória. After their defeat, the Brazilians took their time to greatly fortify entire city as they slowly were pushed backward, every block in the city of God is prepared for the inevitable counter-attack. Many doubt if the Legalists can hold on to the city, given what they describe as the ''Precarious state of the administrative and military sectors'' and ''Lack of leadership present in Rio'', made worse by the recent defection of the Southeastern Military Command and the State of São Paulo, the same however can be said of their foe."

Admiral Rademaker (De Facto leader of the EMC’s military) did not spare the wonderful city from the awe of war, the 2nd Battle of Guanabara will forever be remembered as a turning point in the Brazilian Civil war marking the moment when a dragging and ''indifferent'' war characterized by chaotic skirmishes with low fatalities climaxed into modern warfare the likes of which were last seen in the Second World War.

While both sides lay exhausted the Legalist forces have managed to hold on to the City of God against all odds, a much-needed breath of relief for Goulart’s supporters and a blow to Castelo Branco's junta's moral. Although the fighting has stopped reconstruction efforts are not expected to happen shortly as Admiral Rademaker’s navy continues to bombard the now ruins of Rio, it seems that for the foreseeable future many of its inhabitants will be forced to leave or live among the ruins of a once wonderful city or literally run to the hills in makeshift communities under the watch of the Republican army."

The remaining Legalist forces scatter to the south passing through São Paulo and the Serra do Mar or gather in the refugee slums to form partisan groups or merge with the population, abandoning the war altogether. Although the Legalits defended to the brink of their teeth, the EMC, using decisive coordinated moves with their army and navy, outmatched the barely supplied Legalits and their low numbers. In Rio and Niterói, rallies sympathizing with the EMC floods the bombed-out streets as if Carnaval had come back to the city after years, it is unknown if the Legalits will ever recover their strength and makeup from the losses in the effort to retake the City of God."

That came to an end when it became the staging ground of a proxy war between Coari and the QPM, helping further deliminate Coari's influence in the area.

world.81.d:0 "The open-wide revolt that took over Bahia is having an identity crisis that now leads to more revolts in itself. Following the trend of leftist upheavals that followed Prestes' return to the political scene, the chaotic state of Bahia went on high fever, especially in the South, an area that historically is a hotbed of communists, bandits, and insurgents of all kinds. After the expulsion of federal forces, the area fell under the control of Militias of diverse intentions and beliefs that, small clashes aside, tolerated each other's existence, something that came to an end with the violent rise up of the peasant militias led by Francisco Julião, a continuation of the Prestes' Column. With the fragile balance of Bahia broken, incursions by the Junta, Republic, and others are expected to happen in the state as to bring their vision of order to the shattered Cangaço."

world_dutra.1.desc:0 "Eurico Gaspar Dutra, 16th president of Brazil, has proclaimed himself President of Brazil after marching on Brasília. After the former president, Humberto Castelo Branco, died in an airplane crash the Junta High Command agreed to expel army personnel from Brasília, excepting the Presidential Guard, during the mourning period in an effort to smooth out the power transition. His column, composed of ''Pracinhas'' (WW2 veterans, battle-hardened remarkably loyal to Dutra.), paraded peacefully towards the National Congress, where after reaching it a voting session was broadcasted nationwide, composed of only himself, with foreseen results. Brazil was left in utter shock, an armed struggle is to be expected if Dutra doesn’t give up his claim, radio ways remain flooded by counterclaims from in and out the Junta and Loyalist forces are sure to exploit the growing cracks."
