PEB_a_professionalized_army_desc:0 "Like in the 4th Republic, we must pursue further Army and Military reconstruction as a long-term goal. An army is not a static institution, as it is constantly being changed to the best suit of needs, and we must upkeep it in a manner that is efficient, economical, and practical for our state affairs. So by adopting the 4th Republican army standards and slowly reconstructing it to be no way close to the horrible state it was back in the Confederation, where it was to an extent of relying on militias and mercenary groups."

PEB_united_pernambuco:0 "United Pernambuco"
PEB_united_pernambuco_desc:0 "With Miguel Arraes' current stance to return once more into the open arms of the 4th Republic, a lot of Usineiros' branches began to organize and mobilize against independent Pernambuco's Loyalists and other local allies, and as such, we are obliged to prepare for a possible war."

PEB_stabilizing_control_desc:0 "With the most overt resistance cells dealt with, we must cut off the socialist cause at the root. The people need to know who's in charge.

PEB_appeal_to_the_people_desc:0 "The Junta's reign of terror upon the northeast is at its end. For the remaining Usineiro elites, the nobles of forgotten houses robbed of their ranks, stripped of their possessions, and forced into poverty by hordes of ignorant populists, this is a sign of hope. Without hackneyed collectivization and communal overreach, Arraes will reward any loyal nobles with the full requisition of their old property. We will make Pernambuco prosper once again - together."
PEB_ss4neopernambucoss:0 "§4Neo-Pernambuco§!"
PEB_ss4neopernambucoss_desc:0 "With our way cleared, it is time to declare former loyalty to João Goulart.

We, as the people of §4Pernambuco§! will stay and fight for our right, the right of being part of Brazil once again."
PEB_preparingrecifesdefences:0 "Preparing Recife's Defences"
PEB_preparingrecifesdefences_desc:0 "As war stands closer and closer to our gates, Recife, our capital, must be a fortress that must not be taken by any foreign force but guided by a strong Loyalist hand, and so we must encourage our citizens not to be afraid to fight for our freedom and our way of life, for we have nothing to lose but our chains."
PEB_wartime_workshops:0 "Wartime Workshops"
PEB_wartime_workshops_desc:0 "With most of our current war effort reliefs undergoing, is time we enforce a new wartime policy for our factories, as if they cannot produce the equipment quota, then we are forced to ask non-military workshops to produce equipment for our war that we can afford.

Will of which we continue to fight to restore democracy and a possible return to the Constitution to this part of the republic, where the fight is far from over.

PEB_bringing_back_the_cruzeiro_desc:0 "To better adapt to the 4th Republican civilian markets, we're seeing the need to focus on the most important and most profitable commodities to offer and as part of this very important step, the need to bring back the Republican Cruzeiro currency is now a must priority. In other words, it is a matter of time before the Confederacy's currency goes back into the hands of those who created it, the Usineiros. It's not a bad thing for the civilians, but it does mean that the Cruzeiro is going to be in serious trouble for a long time, not only due to the ongoing civil war but also due to the various military expanses that the [PEB.GetName] relies on."
PEB_reform_the_government:0 "Reform the Government"
PEB_reform_the_government_desc:0 "The need for total governmental reform in favor of a democratic future for our people has never have been one of Arraes' most priorities if it wasn't for the Confederation's Collapse. We need to make sure that we are able to provide the best provisional government until we can move on to a more ideal democratic government as officially part of the 4th Republic."
PEB_approvejangosbasereforms:0 "Approve Jango's Base Reforms"
PEB_approvejangosbasereforms_desc:0 "Some of Jango's Basic Reforms were never properly implemented in the Confederation territory, perhaps due to parts of the structural reforms proposed by his team at the time, which included the educational, fiscal, political, urban, and agrarian sectors, yet as we never correctly adapted most of those laws during the birth and eventually fall of the Confederacy, we are now seeing possibilities of adapting some of his reforms to improve our current stance as part of the 4th Republic."

PEB_support_loyal_labor_syndicates_desc:0 "Not all, but some Pernambucan syndicates remained loyal to our cause even during the total social collapse of the Confederation, mostly because some syndicates saw it as a lost cause, others as an opportunity to maintain their rights and not willing to put into balance and possibly lose their rights and privileges.

PEB_electricity_tax_reform:0 "Electricity Tax Reform"
PEB_electricity_tax_reform_desc:0 "As stated by Miguel Arraes multiple times, one of his utmost worries is the lack of proper electricity in the most remote areas, which barely receive enough energy supplies to maintain safe and regular electricity quota at hospitals and schools, let alone accessible national television and radio stations. Since we no longer lack the political will or leadership needed to address the issue, it is now mandatory a completely reform our taxes upon the usage and construction of electricity throughout the northeast."

PEB_liberalization_of_the_northeastern_economy_desc:0 "Rich with resources, we now can seek to further liberalize our economical centers in favor of a prosperous market, a far cry from the old ''sugar economic'' system that favored the Usineiros and the Usineiros only. It is with the best of our desire, in a prosperous place inside the 4th Republic's borders to be generous in our rights and to be ruthless against those who try to take from us the fruits of our own labor."

PEB_technological_hoarding:0 "Technological Hoarding"
PEB_technological_hoarding_desc:0 "As part of any conflict, the usage of the most updated technology is not to be an oversight but a priority. As we do not want to be stuck relying on outdated methods or technology that our enemy can exploit, it is crucial to keep up to date on all forms of protection and usage, even for our civilians alike, yet, there are several measures that we can take to enforce this. These simple typically instilled acts on even the military level can be taken to prevent accidental or deliberate harm to civilians in our security operations just by hoarding the most updated technology for our military usage first and then sharing on the civilian market."
PEB_better_working_conditions:0 "Better Working Conditions"
PEB_better_working_conditions_desc:0 "Better working conditions are at the heart of any solution, as employers who can't find staff shouldn't be able to stop producing their labor altogether. But another strategy is to build bridges between what's offered in the marketplace and what's offered as many of our loyalist institutions, such as the UNE, approve an overhaul of the way our labor laws for the most specific jobs are handled. The advancements that this could bring to the Provisional Government are to be just as large as any other improvements we may apply to our laws."

PEB_solidarity_for_the_traitors_desc:0 "Even though many took at arms to stand against the return into the Republic's sphere, we are not the ones to judge our traitors.

The current Brazilian government has not yet abandoned any notion of assistance to our stand-off against the Usineiros and local communist rebels, and during these dark times, we are to ask for further support. We are going to ask not Jango specifically, but the people of the United States down in the south, to come together, as one, and help us in every way they can."

PEB_wiping_the_slate_clean_desc:0 "Arraes may not have been the most popular alternative to take the lead.

PEB_the_army_back_home:0 "The Army Back Home"
PEB_the_army_back_home_desc:0 "While most of our army is on the frontlines, we got to ask ourselves about the ones back home, those who are leaving for basic training, or even the ones going into the service as we speak, and most importantly, the ones garrisoning our checkpoints all over the country. What is the daily life that these armed soldiers go through without proper support given by the Provisional authority as soldiers train to become the vanguards that guard our borders, so, we must give them the proper care."
PEB_the_frontline_barrels:0 "The Frontline Barrels"
PEB_the_frontline_barrels_desc:0 "The combatants are nothing without their uniform, the weapon is nothing without its ammunition and the soldier is nothing without both of these things. However, all of this depends on the support of an armory and the supplies we provide to our troops, as of today, we are currently increasing the development programs for most of the infantry-related gear. Best of all, when the new armories have finished testing, we will be able to ensure our frontline barrels are well equipped as our enemies."
