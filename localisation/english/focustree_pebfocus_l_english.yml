For the remaining Usineiro elites, the nobles of forgotten houses robbed of their ranks, stripped of their possessions, and forced into poverty by hordes of ignorant populists, this is a sign of hope. Without hackneyed collectivization and communal overreach, Arraes will reward any loyal nobles with the full requisition of their old property. We will make Pernambuco prosper once again - together."
