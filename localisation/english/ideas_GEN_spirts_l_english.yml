GEN_the_devil_in_the_bottle_desc:0 "Hero to some, terrorist to others, Carlos Marighella, leader of the communist urban-guerrilla ALN, The Alliance for the Liberation of the Nation, is currently being held prisoner by the State Police and awaiting trial. Accused of everything from bank robbing to high treason, Marighella is probably one of the most dangerous men in the state. The people can now sleep safe knowing that the Boogieman of São Paulo lies safely behind bars, soon never to be a problem again."

GEN_stolen_institutions_desc:0 "Like many other Brazilian states, São Paulo lives in a nebulous state of independence, neither under the 4th Republic’s nor Junta’s control, but still depending on institutions established before the governmental collapse, like the State Police and Administration. Uniquely, however, São Paulo is big and developed enough to sustain itself and the institutions within its borders, it's just a matter of cleaning up the confusion and cutting off the last remaining ties to Rio and Brasília so that our operations can be truly independent."

GEN_shattered_economy_desc:0 "The State’s economy, heavily based on coffee exports and imports from beyond the sea lies destroyed by the isolation we have brought upon ourselves, with the Republic and Junta teaming up to embargo us, in a clear attempt to sway our numerous resources and populations towards their treacherous schemes… To save the Constitution, we must turn this around and reclaim our place as the richest state in Brazil, even if by dubious ways!"

GEN_the_2nd_constitutionalist_revolution_desc:0 "Adhemar’s last and greatest gamble, the Second Constitutionalist Revolution sent shockwaves across Brazil despite its lack of direct bloodshed. Its declaration came after the 4th Republic’s refusal to hold elections, the Former Southeastern Military Command and its forces were ‘’convinced’’ by Governor Adhemar de Barros to break away from the loyalist army, declaring its late neutrality in the Brazilian Civil War. Its real goals are hazy, to say the least, and it’s hard to say if its spokesperson really believes in them or is merely taking advantage of the Paulista ‘’patriotism’’ for his gain. Regardless of Adhemar’s intentions meticulous propaganda efforts and surgical police actions secured the initial support of the Paulista people and sparked a new sense of duty and responsibility for the state. Slowly but surely the Revolution’s namesake goal is becoming mainstream, to Uphold the Brazilian Constitution at any cost necessary, which can either be a useful tool if São Paulo seeks to truly follow its course or a massive problem for its corrupt Governor."
