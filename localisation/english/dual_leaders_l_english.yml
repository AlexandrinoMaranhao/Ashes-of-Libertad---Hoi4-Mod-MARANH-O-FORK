 SAO_ADHEMAR_DESC:0 "Born in Piracicaba in 1901 to a traditional coffee planter family, Adhemar Pereira de Barros did many things in his life, from being a revolutionary in the §Y1932 Constitutionalist Revolution§! against the Vargas Regime to running for President twice in 1955 and 1960, despite it all, he never stopped being a proud member of the historical Paulista Elite class. At the break of the civil war in 1963, when the Legalists started out with significant victories on the Center-east front, the §gSoutheastern Military Command§!, synonymous with the state of São Paulo, decided to align itself with the Republican forces of §GGeneral Lott§! in exchange for political and economic promises that would assure that the costly way of life of the Paulista Elite would live on despite the apocalypse and the war. But as the years went by and the ''Couping Gorillas'' of Brasília gathered their potential strength, The oligarchs and high-class families started to grow unruly, their wealth was being drained and no profit was made in return. \nSeeing his political base begin to slip away from his hands Adhemar acted fast to secure his position as the head of state, in a public speech that send shockwaves across the nation Adhemar effectively declared São Paulo as an independent state, bringing a tense peace to the region in the form of a cease-fire with the Junta, and so was born the §YSecond Constitutionalist Revolution§!. \nDespite this ''Revolutionary Charade'' not all is well in the city of drizzle, the Constitutionalist part of its name puts Adhemar in direct opposition to his former ally the 4th Republic, and the Junta now stares at him with hungry eyes, ready to march into the state's capital if the people show themselves favorable to it.\n\n Adhemar's gamble may have gained him some time to enjoy his remaining luxuries, but the Revolution's foundations are flawed and his commitment to it minimal, it's a matter of time before his castle of cards comes crashing down bringing São Paulo with it."
