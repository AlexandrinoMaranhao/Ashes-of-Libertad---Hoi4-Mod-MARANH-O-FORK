 ACR_intro_three_desc:0 "The people of the Republic are more diverse than one may predict, composed of all sorts of people from places as far as Ceará and the Levant, one thing unites them all however, the Rubber trade..."
 ACR_intro_final_desc:0 "Regardless of where you stand, as a tapper, as a politician or as a militia fighter one thing is certain for you, your future and that of the republic is uncertain at best..."
 ACR_the_1967_constitution_desc:0 "In 1963 after the republic's founding it was decided that a constitution must be written, not by one man or a group, but by the people, now after 5 years that can finally be done."
 ACR_minorities_no_desc:0 "The discussion about the native case is over, it was decided that the best option for coexistence with them is separation, some of these voices seem honest about their decision, some appear to be based on petty racism, regardless, the vote is now over."
 ACR_minorities_yes_desc:0 "The discussion about the native case is over, it was decided that the best option for coexistence with them is integration, some of these voices seem honest about their decision, some appear to be based on ''the white man's burden'' way of thinking, regardless, the vote is now over."
 ACR_press_no_desc:0 "The discussion about the press's case is over, it was decided that the best option is controlling the press and keeping it free of dangerous thoughts to the Republic."
 ACR_press_yes_desc:0 "The discussion about the press's case is over, it was decided that the best option is freedom of speech and thought to the citizens, keeping us true to our founding beliefs of liberalism."

 ACR_workers_yes_desc:0 "The discussion about the worker's cause is over, it was decided that the republic's economic needs come first, especially in these troubling times."
 ACR_the_red_menace_desc:0 "To the south lies our greatest and oldest enemy, Bolivia, corrupted and controlled by an army of bloodthirsty revolutionaries always plotting, planning, regrouping and slowly getting ready to attack our young republic once again, we must be ready for when that day comes."
 ACR_defend_in_the_cities_desc:0 "When Che Guevara first attacked years before our most astonishing victory came in the city of Brasiléia, it has become clear that Che has little experience in an urban environment, we shall use this to our advantage."
 ACR_defend_in_the_jungle_desc:0 "Acre is a place of thick and dense jungle with few civilized places, although Che Guevara's men are used to fighting in such terrain it is also the perfect place to wage a defensive war."
 ACR_conscription_law_desc:0 "What we call a defense force is constituted of a series of independent militias that operate autonomously, that often leads to problems like infighting between militias and abuse of power, they are however all united under the goal of protecting Acre's people, and therefore will listen to the government once we take action to control then, the question is, how will we do this. "
 ACR_general_of_the_people_desc:0 "The time has come to elect an all powerful leader of our armed forces, after much discussion between the parties the senate chose Jorge Kalume, former leader of the ''Beirut Militia'' and popular hero from Che's skirmish as our General."
 ACR_general_of_the_army_desc:0 "The time has come to elect an all powerful leader of our armed forces, after much discussion between the parties the senate chose Edgar Cerqueira, candidate to the presidency, ex-governor of Acre and former leader of the 14th Frontier Battalion from before Acre's independence as our General."
 ACR_involvement_of_the_army_in_politics_desc:0 "The Militaristic party has fomented a most unusual discussion in the senate, they argue that members of the armed forces should have extra power when discussing politics, or even have exclusive rights within the senate emulating ancient Rome's senatorial system, although some find this to be ridiculous the vote was called anyway, and the results were..."
 ACR_the_senate_desc:0 "The Senate of Rio Branco is an effort to bring the distant and dispersed voices of the communities of Acre together under a single roof, so that they can, together, decide Acre's road forward, it has proven to be a massive headache so far but after many years of preparation progress has finally began..."
 ACR_appoint_senator_1_desc:0 "Naturally the senators began to group together with like minded folk inside the voting chamber, slowly creating Acre's first political parties, amongst those senators one voice spoke louder than others, that of Hélio Cury."
 ACR_appoint_senator_2_desc:0 "Naturally the senators began to group together with like minded folk inside the voting chamber, slowly creating Acre's first political parties, amongst those senators one voice spoke louder than others, that of Edgar Cerqueira."
 ACR_appoint_senator_3_desc:0 "Naturally the senators began to group together with like minded folk inside the voting chamber, slowly creating Acre's first political parties, amongst those senators one voice spoke louder than others, that of Marques de Souza."
 ACR_economy_law_desc:0 "The commerce of Latex and rubber, the so-called Black Gold, is what gives life to Acre and it's people. Therefore it is important that our direction moving forward is decided as early as possible and is made clear to all people who may care."
 ACR_censorship_desc:0 "The Senate is assembled to further discuss the matter of the militias and police force, how they should operate and treat the citizens."
 ACR_anticensorship_desc:0 "The Senate is assembled to discuss the matter of education of the young in the new republic."
 ACR_power_of_the_senate_desc:0 "How powerful should the Senate be, a question that keeps generating discussion in the Rio Branco Palace day after day, some argue that the president should be able to overrule it, some wish to copy the US or even the British Parliamentary system, in the end it was decided that..."
 ACR_right_of_vote_desc:0 "The Right to Vote was once a privilege, in a liberal democracy such as this it is expected that all members of the republic should be able to vote, however, there are some that wish to go back to traditional ways, with more limitations."
 ACR_no_rest_for_the_sick_desc:0 "The Militaristic party keeps adding complaints to the pile, today's was they have pushed a little too far with their request, that of the declaration of ''state of siege'' claiming the threat of Che Guevarra's army should bring immediate army reforms, total mobilisation and emergency draft. Some claim however that such drastic measures so early in the Republic's lifetime could prove catastrophic."
 ACR_finish_the_constitution_desc:0 "All decisions made, all senators present, all parties assembled together under one roof, today is the great day when Acre will become a true country, founded by principles set in paper but made of steel, and now, finally, the Senate can come together once more and vote for the Acre's Republic first President."
#####################
# Cury
#####################
ACR_cury_presidency_desc:0 "The results are in, and with double confirmation, Hélio Cury is now the new president of the Acrean Republic. Many citizens are celebrating on the streets, calling a new age for democracy. It is our duty to keep our promises right, so don't lose your head."
ACR_regulate_expansion_rubber_plantations_desc:0 "As his first reform in office, Hélio now begins and brings to the senate floor a program, with the intention of regulating the current unregulated tapper industry, conserving it to survive for future generations. Many senators are unsure to think of this, and he knows that. His plan is to diplomatically and democratically make a compromise with the help of his voters and public support, and then pass his adjustments."
ACR_compromise_with_technocrats_desc:0 "Two sides of the same coin: If we were to compromise with the Technocrats to pass the conservation laws, they will ask for some favors in return. It could be more professionals assuming leadership or more control in the bureaucracy in Acre. But this also means they wouldn't like severely monetizing it for profit. This is critical, so if we are going this path, we must be aware of the consequences."
ACR_end_correrias_desc:0 "Correrias, to simply put, are the action of a pre-emptive attack on natives communities in order to use their land for whatever the intention of the invasion is. Like clearing the area for rubber plantation, using the trees for loggers or gold mining. Putting an end to it is nothing but a service to humanity."
ACR_compromise_with_militarists_desc:0 "Two sides of the same coin: The militarists are always an open option, and if we want them on our side, they will want more control over the nation. They would want more seats in the senate, more money spent on the industrial capacity of acre plus the army, and of course a plan against the ERN. Although they will oblige to the terms of conservation of the rubber industry and our plan to monetize that, their requests are in our terms a bit aggressive, so thinking wise before signing this contract."
ACR_intervene_seringalist_rallies_desc:0 "We saw this coming and we are resolving it just now, unironically. Tapper workers and industrialists are rallying at all sides from the republic calling for the repeal of correrias. The outrage and stress from this can be seen on our cabinets growing distress. We surely will find a way to make concessions out of this, just need time."
ACR_compromise_with_tappers_desc:0 "Ok, we finally found an accord with the Tappers. We will let them stay in any occupied area by ongoing Correrias and expand on it but never go ever to a designated area that is specifically for native tribes. We wished we could agree to better terms for the natives' interests, but that's the only way they would accept, and hopefully everything should calm down now."
ACR_buying_votes_senate_desc:0 "After all the Correrias controversy, the Senate is divided. They won't allow us to pass more reforms that they now call ''Extremists''. The only way we see to overcome this is by buying their votes for favors or whatever they need or want. This wasn't the way we planned on going, but we need to regain their loyalty for our plans to move forward again."
ACR_creation_native_reserves_desc:0 "All the paperwork has been signed, and it's now official: The native people can now rest easy knowing that the government has assigned special zones to live and thrive while being protected by law against Tappers. While not in their ancestors homeland, these reserves will protect them enough from most tappers."
ACR_create_native_militias_desc:0 "While being safeguarded by the republic is good, There is still the big threat of Lawbreakers thinking they are too smart for their own greed. To counteract this, we are allowing the natives to arm themselves to defend immediately when an invasion occurs. This cost should give the Indians enough independence so they don't have to always rely on us."
ACR_natives_in_army_desc:0 "The militarists have given us news that the Native Voluntary Divisions has finally completed their training! We now have an native army that has no trouble dealing with the deeps of the jungle in the amazon. It should give us an advantage if Che ever decides to attack us and contact other tribes in the region."
ACR_pass_native_defence_act_desc:0 "And with the senate's trust, we made another breakthrough. The Native Defense Act gives the Natives the same citizenship as all Acreans in the republic, and considers any crimes against them as highly offensive with life sentences. And thus, another win in our books."
ACR_give_them_voice_desc:0 "We have given the natives protection, rights and now a place in our politics. A pure blooded native will now be a senator, having the same power as all others. Plus, there will be a new Newspaper specially made for them, while the name is still subject to change, many agree to call it ''O Guarani''."
ACR_found_funai_desc:0 "The Fundação Nacional de Inteligência is now operational and on stand-by. The FUNAI, for short, is an intelligence agency that uses volunteer native workforce in missions of diplomacy with all other native tribes in the amazon rainforest. They are not limited to deep jungle infiltration and guerrilla, rudimentary spy work and jungle warfare, and mixing classic native american knowledge about the jungle with good old white western warfare."
ACR_railroad_to_heaven_desc:0 "The new mechanization endeavors are starting to become real. Our engineers have shown the possibility of a railroad connecting us to all of brazil again through the Madeira-Mamoré railroad. Truly amazing and creative ideia, yes. And of course, there is a ''but'' to all of it..."
ACR_passing_through_hell_desc:0 "...Which is the big elephant in the room: That railroad is owned by Che Guevarra from the ERN. So if we are going to use it, we need to plan for war. The engineers have laid out the schematics of a giant War Train to break through their guerrillas, which now requested for funding. May god protect us from this evil."
ACR_bringing_electricity_to_acre_desc:0 "Using the rich rive system of Acre it's possible to make damns and gather electricity from them, even if rudimentary so, that way electricity can be brought to event the farthest places of the country."
ACR_defend_acre_little_princess_desc:0 "Xapuri is no ordinary town, but the only hub of local trades that in turn trades with Rio Branco to then be barter back on the amazonian marketplace. So in summary, if Xapuri is ever raided, the small owner business properties that can't afford to sell on further away markets wont move their goods to the Rio Branco market, so it would slow to a crawl, which could make our economy collapse for lack of goods. It is important to have the military nearby in case anything happens."
ACR_xapuri_acre_pride_desc:0 "Why just rubber? Why limit ourselves? We sell rubber, sell nuts as well! As part of diversifying the economy, so we don't have to rely on one single resource, we are highly encouraging the plantation of Pará-nuts in Xapuri so our production becomes more independent besides rubber."
ACR_revise_sni_actions_acre_desc:0 "The SNI is acting on it's on. Sometimes it does things that we never ordered them to do and other times they do the complete opposite, ordering them and not filling it. Although many call for a reshuffle or the complete disband of the cabinet, we decided to do some revisions that may do the trick. We'll see what were our mistakes and what needs to be punished with reason."
ACR_dream_big_desc:0 "Although acre wasn't a wide state like Pará or Amazonas, we could become a tall, developed nation if we use all our territory to its fullest potential. But Acre alone isn't enough, luckly for us the Upper Amazon is still in a state of Anarchy and plans for annexing it can, and will, be drafted and readied."
ACR_acre_fortune_for_acre_alone_desc:0 "Even with the horrors of nuclear war, the chaos with the brazilian civil war and the collapse of other countries around Latin America, we've managed to make lemonade out of our situation: Our economy is increasing at absurd levels, our influence can be seen around the amazon and the wealth of all our citizens is higher that even São Paulo in their golden age. This is the first ever Acrean miracle, and we must keep it rolling."
ACR_meeting_our_neighbours_desc:0 "The Amazon is a big forest, a big world for us, and we must come to terms with their civilized inhabits. We are establishing small embassies with the QPM, Coari and the economic trade center of the rainforest, Manaus. Manaus and Acre have similar interests and goals. we, after all, are city states. And of course, we both fear the Brazilian Republic reabsorbed us, and our fate as so. Let's hope we both combine our powers so nothing like this ever happens."
ACR_establish_relations_with_manaus_desc:0 "After various talks, we've finally established relations with Manaus. With their official recognition, we now have a spotlight with trade deals that should give us access to greater goods."
ACR_create_fluvial_defense_fleet_desc:0 "Looks like we are attracting the wrong kind of attention from our growing riches. We've recently got a report of a interception in the coarense river system caused by pirates, that pillaged everything. The senate, worrying about future attacks from the success of said interception, has given the clear to create a River Navy or Fluvial Defense Fleet to protect and secure convoys for next trade deals."
ACR_close_doors_desc:0 "Although our situation right now is good, we must check everything and everywhere for failures so nobody can take advantage. Northeast of Rio Branco, the abandoned settlement of Boca do Acre, and North of Feijó, Envira, are uninhabited since the breakout of the great war. They both have rivers that connect to said cities in Acre and if they are left as they are, we could be victims of major attacks. Our armies have been given orders to absorb them and turn it to bases for future operations."
ACR_manaus_rio_branco_pact_desc:0 "With all the dangers and threats that linger upon us, Hélio and Mestrinho met at Rio Branco to finally announce a mutual military defense alliance that protects both nations in the event of foreigh aggression whatever justifier claims has been made. The world is pretty big, and we must have someone covering our backs."
ACR_buy_guns_from_manaus_desc:0 "The Small Arms and Ammunition producers of Manaus are a force to be reckoned with, as they control the arms trade all over the Amazon. With them at our side, supplying our army against the ERN will bring us wonders and less worries if we continue to get a continuous stream of it from the river system. "
ACR_ease_bringing_of_equipment_desc:0 "We made really good friends. The ones that actually care about you in a post-apocalyptic scenario. Manaus is actively looking out for us, and ourselves doing the exact same thing, we are getting less bureaucratic measures when buying anything from their respective commerce. Nothing like good diplomacy can't do any trick."
ACR_buy_mechanization_desc:0 "We are finally advancing prestigilly in the amazon, as if, we are finally attracting the big industrial players in manaus to build and expand their factories here in Acre to bring the wonders of high quality and luxury goods, with the latter being things like Engines, TVs and Radios."
ACR_lower_cost_of_everything_desc:0 "Our brother from another mother, Manaus, is everything and anything we could ever need. Our benefits from buying and trading with them keeps increasing, discounts are abundant and we are getting preferential treatment. To repay their kindness, we think it would be a great idea to make a commercial pact with them with even more benefits and better deals, benefiting both sides since there will be more people wanting to buy from there."
ACR_buy_medicine_desc:0 "Our commerce and Manaus are becoming more connected than ever, and as so, they are investing in our territory. A new hospital financed by them is being built right here in Rio Branco, and it's standing out amongst the rest by having top of the line pre-war equipment. Another step to becoming a giant."
ACR_medicine_crisis_desc:0 "Another crisis involving Coari's piracy problem has begun. We were buying more medicine and transporting doctors to work in our hospitals from manaus, promising a better life and a good pay. But when a giant pirate fleet intercepted the convoys transporting all of it, as soon as we entered Coari's river system, things took from the worst and they are all now hostage. People's lives are on the line, and we must find a solution to this problem, and fast."
ACR_compromise_with_coari_desc:0 "Coari's is making things difficult, but we must be tougher. We are trying to reach the pirate leader via radio to see their demands and finally see if we can find a compromise, if not, military intervention might be our only solution."
ACR_coarense_soneth_desc:0 "The ultimatum has been given, and their decision is going to change their fate forever. We have proposed to them complete economic and army support from us in exchange of controlling all traffic in their river systems for an indefinite amount of time, until Acre has seen it can return safely to her owner. We now wait for their response."
ACR_end_acre_stagnation_desc:0 "We can definitely now say that we are all in our golden age. Our levels of development are the highest they have ever been, the economy is booming, our citizens have access to the best luxury goods market can offer them, we are the most democratic and stable nation in our stand in South America, and corruption is the lowest it can be. Hélio Cury is the Hero of Acre! May our prosperity reach even greater heights!"
ACR_remember_rubber_battle_desc:0 "We are getting a new wave of immigrants coming from all sides. Peru, Rondônia, Bolívia and even the nearby Amazon settlements. All of them are Rubber soldiers, otherwise, tappers. According to the minister of immigration, they came here looking to settle down, since acre is not a warzone or civil war like the rest of south america. ''A place of peace and prosperity'' they say."
ACR_forgotten_piracinhas_desc:0 "The Rubber soldiers deserve more. They fought battle after battle with little to no reward. It is the government responsibility to give them the proper pensions, housing and medical care for the horrors they have faced headon. We are also reintegrating volunteers into our army for those who wish to fight for our country until their last breath."
ACR_acre_for_acreans_desc:0 "After everything, the wars, the discrimination, the inequality amogst poor and wealthy, and the slums of our nation, we have stood strong. All of the dread the world could throw at us, and we have prosper. Our economy is flourishing, the Madeira-Mamoré railroad has opened us to the rest of Brazil, Our army is our pride, and we are being called the Beacon of Liberty of the Amazon. This is what we have become, and Hélio is the one to thank for this."

# University #

ACR_the_university_of_rio_branco_desc:0 "In an agreement between groups of politicians, urbanists and the teachers of Rio Branco, it was decided to create the institution of the University of Rio Branco, the great public university of Acre. Building a new structure is not something easy, and lots of money and resources will have to be used in our project, therefore an opposition to the plan exists, but our republic decided. Now, architects are already debating about how the university will be, and public offices are organizing the masons, calling engineers, and calculating what needs to be calculated.\n\nSoon the students of Acre now will be able to do third-stage education, our teachers will be able to teach and learn deeply, and our nation continues to grow and develop."
ACR_lay_down_the_groundwork_desc:0 "In the morning some geologists, together with a public planner, analyse the area of Rio Branco to know the location that we are able to build the university. The next day, a committee of urban planners already decided where our project will be implemented. Finally, after some days of discussion and calculation, we already know where the University of Rio Branco will be, the foundations are set, masons already have been called."
ACR_gather_engineers_desc:0 "In ministerial offices, typewriters moan while workers discuss and lists and telephone calls are made. Our state is searching for engineers, and with them, their plans. After a couple days, we already contacted enough engineers, some from private groups and others from the government ranks. Now who write and discuss are those professionals, together with our architects and a government group to check the expenditure of resources. Calculations are being made, measurements analysed, projects drawn, and we look to the horizon of Rio Branco knowing that the capital will be blessed with a great educational and culture center."
ACR_begin_construction_desc:0 "In the borders of the urban region of Rio Branco, the structure is being raised. Lots of noise on all working days, a bit of smoke, a few trucks coming and going, workers on their sacred duty of building what will be one of the most important places of the republic. All the resources needed are being provided, we already can feel the expense of the project, but this investment is necessary and will bring development to our nation, this construction certainly will be a mark in the history of this region."
ACR_the_university_completed_desc:0 "In a few weeks, the University of Rio Branco will be open. We already called teachers of public schools, several students already matriculated, and workers are employed. The university is a neoclassical building, a modern classic, but it is ironically called ''Oca'', in reference to the indigenous structures. The building does not look like an Oca, barely there are students with indigenous origins, but inside the group of teachers it is understood that the university is a collective house of the minds, a communal haven of knowledgence.\n\nThe inauguration of our university shows the grandiosity of Acre, the grandiosity of our nation and its republic. In a year, we will have students with more specialities, in some three years, specialized workers and teachers adequate to modern education, and with time a intelectual class will grow, civil technology will advance, and Acre will continue on its grandiosity."
ACR_east_wing_expansion_desc:0 "In a classroom of the university, a group of half-dozen architects aggressively discussed what style or school of architecture the next expansions of the university would follow. The centre of the Acrean upper education is a neoclassical building, demonstrating our greatness and sublimity, but the university expansion, a building to the east, follows modernism, a relatively new style in our region.\n\nWhen we inaugurate this expansion, our university will have several new specialized machinery and rooms, to the most diverse areas of knowledgence. The strength and wisdom of our nation is shown in this structure."
ACR_west_wing_expansion_desc:0 "Some politicians, influenced by external groups, tried to bar the project of expanding the University of Rio Branco. Certain people think that education is a useless spending of public money and resources, but anyway, the project was accepted. Our population desires education, from the nascent group of intellectuals to the illiterate parents who want their children to study more than a few grades. And our government, representing all sections of the population, knows that expanding the university structure will help all of us.\n\nSome meters to the west of the university, a new building will be inaugurated, with new classrooms, we already can hire new teachers, and new students are coming to the city."
ACR_art_of_thought_desc:0 "Despite the opposition from some politicians and sectors of the government, the teacher class convinced us, and our university will focus on classes with the goal of deeply educating the students, teaching them how to learn. From the first to the last chants, our students and graduating teachers will receive a great focus in the understanding of literature, which is a form of art that reflects, explains and helps to mold the world. Of course the great majority of books here are from Brasilian writers, and that is a good thing, and particularly we plan to focus on indianist literature, such as the works of Gonçalves Dias. Our people will grow intellectually, our nation learns, but we must be sure that our youth does not fall into macunaimical thoughts and nihilisms."
ACR_art_of_war_desc:0 "Laying plans and doing the initial estimations, we understand that the most urgent focus is developing our military, and our university will help with it, forming students who can be more than soldiers. We see the challenge, and plan the offensive - we will call more teachers with military backgrounds, and volunteers will receive classes to perceive, to know about timing, opportunity and how to engage the force. This education will help us train spies and develop incendiary attacks, even knowing the importance of flexibility, the only immediate need is this new military thought. Fielding, positioning… the army of our nation will know the terrain they see."
ACR_platos_cave_desc:0 "The civilization we create is, in many aspects, alienating. Plato knew about that, and he describes a cave, where the masses do not have access to real understanding, but only to shadows of forms, manipulated by the groups in power. And living in a region far from the main capitals of the old country, Acre not only repeats the alienating character of our social organization, but its people also hardly have access to further philosophical influence and thought. But that is changing. \n\nWe have a nascent intellectual class, the philosophy graduates of our nation already do all they can to leave the cave, to think freely, to have conscience of the real and the ideal. And our education is developing, it will take time, but our nation will be free from useless illusions. We are perceiving better the world of the senses, and thinking better the world of ideas."
ACR_war_academy_desc:0 "We already can see, many of our soldiers know more than just following rules. Of course they continue to be extremely obedient, but they know what war is, and with time we will have an army of people who understand the terrain and the conditions of the battle. In the higher ranks of the army, we have officers who have access to more recent books and information, many officers dialogue with specialists in war history. People go to the classrooms, books go to the military offices, and knowledgence goes to the barracks."
ACR_education_for_all_desc:0 "We do not want our nation to continue in those simple-minded times, we know that we must progress in every aspect of public life, therefore it is needed to develop an education for all, that will bring enlightenment. Education is one of the basis of a society, it reflects how it is organized, and it helps to change or develop this society. We want more just times, so we need an education that embraces all of the people of Acre, from the workers to the heirs of companies. In Rio Branco we already have a center of knowledgence, a place that will form all the people of our nation - at least the ones who have access to it."
ACR_education_for_the_elite_desc:0 "Some people are more important than others, this everyone knows. But what some ignore is that certain people are better than others, and of course those are the ones fit to rule. Maybe those people are not even better, but at least they are richer, they already have influence, therefore their children are the ones who we must care about, they are the future of this nation. Some courses will have to be paid, so we already can get more money and resources. \n\nThe elites are who maintain this country, so their sons and daughters deserve to be the ones privileged by our system."
ACR_the_elites_elite_desc:0 "Our elite is not just the bankers or the captain of industry anymore, a new elite is growing from inside of the old one. Now, the heirs of the old elite and being educated, learning the finest literature, doing organized sports. The son of the steel industry boss now knows about the peculiarities of metals and understands how to rule the production of a nation. The daughter of the rich landowner studies the plants, the weather, and knows the specificities of the farming. An elite can be a great thing, but only when it is educated."
ACR_tappers_no_more_desc:0 "Our production and industry is growing and developing, but for many years, the workers did not get any improvement in their lives. Education does not change society easily, but without it, we see that nothing changes. Now, the workers have access to education, to the university, and their children already are learning about many different topics. Those people can try getting other jobs, the ones who continue as tappers can know their rights and be more respected. The cultural consciousness in the working class is a great advancement, but we hope they do not adhere to radical political thoughts."
ACR_extra_research_slot_1_desc:0 "After the work of our engineers and masons, the organization of bureaucrats, weeks and months pass, students and teachers teach and learn, and we now can say that the west wing of the university is operating completely well. Our investment and its efforts turned out to be a great idea, our educational system now can form more people, with even better speciality and knowledgence."
ACR_extra_research_slot_2_desc:0 "Our efforts were not in vain. To the east of the university, a modernist building receives a great influx of teachers and students. This new building contains more classrooms and is part of our long project of developing the education of our nation. Educating a people takes a long time, many years, but we already can see some of the fruits of our investment, the students and teachers are engaging in their own education, an intellectual class continues to grow, and the university continues to bring opportunities and enlightenment."
ACR_mr_carneiros_class_desc:0 "A notable frequenter of the University of Rio Branco, who teaches and takes classes, is Enéas Carneiro, graduated in medicine, planning to continue his studies on cardiology. Enéas is a polymath, he studies different areas of knowledgence, attentively listens to physics and mathematics classes, participates in debates about philosophy and the portuguese language. Enéas name is growing in politics, most people in Rio Branco know his criticism of globalized capitalism, the soviet system, and the weakness of the small new states of this region. No one really knows what is inside the brain behind the glasses and the recent moustache, other than his knowledgence, inflammatory discourse and his sympathies for Kant and Popper.\n\nWe do not know what Enéas Carneiro plans, if he will try becoming a relevant figure in politics, but we can be sure of his influence in the intellectual class of Rio Branco."

ACR_marques_presidency_desc:0 "Marques de Souza, champion of workers's rights and leader of the Technocratic party, has triumphed. Having been narrowly elected President of the Acrean Republic, the new leader has been lauded by rubber tappers and impoverished as much as he is demonized by corporations and businessmen. All now wait eagerly for the firebrand's first actions in office."
ACR_worker_cause_desc:0 "Without workers, a nation is nothing. So why do laborers continue to suffer under trinket wages, horrible conditions, and brutal treatment? Why do their corporate overlords treat them as if they were slaves of antiquity? President de Souza will waste no time. He will take the battle for the worker to the Senate."
ACR_compromise_with_nationalists_desc:0 "Perhaps we judged the Nationalists too harshly. While they are certainly not perfect, we can agree with them on many counts. Their fight for the legal equality of natives, for instance, is admirable. We will throw them a bone and offer to pass some legislation in accordance with their platform - if they'd do the same with ours."
ACR_compromise_with_militarists_two_desc:0 "The Militarists are our enemy. Their leaders are openly hostile towards our fairly elected government, and rumors of a planned coup are even surfacing. Yet, we also need their votes in order to pass our reforms. A deal with the devil will be offered. We will support those of their initiatives which are not entirely disagreeable, should they vote for ours."
ACR_promise_to_limit_reforms_desc:0 "Our radical promises and changes to labor policy and rights has alarmed even some moderates within our faction. Now that we have struck a compromise with our political opponents, we will publicly dial back the reforms and begin acting on our promises, all in the name of ensuring their votes."
ACR_haha_sike_desc:0 "...or not. While we need to keep up a facade of moderation in public, piecemeal reform and limited change will not suffice here. To keep our opponents in the dark about our true policies, we will control the press and flow of information through censorship, replacing coverage of our legislation with entertainment such as TV shows and plays."
ACR_revise_worker_rights_desc:0 "Sometimes you need to crack a few eggs in order to make an omelette. We are doing some behind the scenes reforms focusing on our rubber fields, but some people just don't see our way of thinking and as a result, we are ''pulling apart'' their plantations. We are still going to plan forward on how to get them together again, but for now we'll continue with our goals as per usual."
ACR_medicare_for_all_desc:0 "Medicare for All"
ACR_placido_castro_hospital_desc:0 "Great to amazing news for all people of Acre! Our new and modern hospital in Rio Branco has finally been inaugurated! With this in mind, we can finally attend more patients at a time plus faster and shorter recoveries! Truly a time that all of us will be alive for!"
ACR_jungle_hospitals_desc:0 "To think that we would limit ourselves to a centered budget concentrating in Rio Branco is worrying, since this money could be used for building minor hospitals around the rural, remote areas plus regional trade centers of Acre that could make a difference for low class workers. The senate has decided to do just that, and approved the accountentes with the money to do it."
ACR_education_for_common_man_desc:0 "A man should not be denied the basic right to education, no matter their age, social status or if they are a worker or a businessman. It is important for the next generations that they become educated and ready for the changes of the world, for the future lies with them."
ACR_generic_education_desc:0 "We all think that the books that our children get should be the ones that are the best, so they can develop critical thinking and skills that can be used later down in life. If otherwise, our system that they will inherit could collapse from inexperience."
ACR_selected_books_desc:0 "Let's be honest, children must be guided by their parents, or else they would get lost in a world of supposed ''free choice''. We can't let them choose another philosophy different than ours, that would mean our demise. So that's why we are going to raise them with books made especially for them, so we can secure our future."
ACR_make_changes_last_desc:0 "The brain drain that the civil war brought upon us is finally starting to improve, slowly but surely. The graduates from our universities now publicly debate with the people, like the farmers and tappers, to the many philosophical questions that our nation has now. It sparked a tiny intellectual elite that daily speak about such things, in general, the population is now smarter and conscious about their lives. Could we be the next big players in the new world?"
ACR_battle_manaus_monopoly_desc:0 "Manaus is running on a exploited system. They don't care about the worker, the common man. They only care about their aristocrat elite and filling their pockets full of the low class hard earnings. and they don't see that reality, they just accept it. It's sickly just thinking about it. Down with the ruling class of Manaus and their government!"
ACR_starve_them_out_desc:0 "We know how to cut the throat of this pig. We'll close our rubber trades for them and watch them bleed without their precious resource. We will suffer a bit but our nation is bound to work around that. If they can survive the aftermath, and endure the pain that will cause, they will be weak to crush and destroy."
ACR_make_manaus_beg_desc:0 "While war has not been declared, we need to make something. So we shall suffocate Manaus with a embargo until they cave in to our demands. Should they neglect our offers, a military action by either side will be eminent."
ACR_capitalism_for_communism_sake_desc:0 "The Rubber trade has progressively going forward at a steady rate, to the point we can divert a vast majority of it's growing welfare to social programs for workers and public arts, as an example. Many think of a backup plan when the profit eventually windles, and we will do that, but for now we keep it up as long as we can."
ACR_desperate_negotiations_desc:0 "Time has been going fast since Che Guevara attacked us. All of our government cabinets have been in high tension since then. Sure we stopped his offensive, but everyone believes he will do it for a second time. We directed all of our nation's resources into contacting Che, and hopefully we can sort everything out."
ACR_flirt_with_communists_desc:0 "Che Guevara lies just bellow us in Bolivia with his army, and they may prove themselves useful for our national interests.

ACR_red_flags_in_border_desc:0 "With Che evermore close to us, we can finally start putting up flags that, unknown to the public, are sympathetic to their cause. It's a test, to make known to the guerrillas that we are not the enemy, but instead, a valuable ally. We are opening it up near the rivers, roads near the border, and even on town centers of border towns."
ACR_hotline_guevara_desc:0 "After our first signs of cooperation have been successful, we have decided to install a telephone line directly with Che Guevara, approaching even more our nations and ensuring that so no incidents may happen between our troops and their soldiers. Even if a further alliance fail, this phone line will make sure that both nations are safe."
ACR_show_our_intentions_desc:0 "We've finally done it. Channels with the ERN and Che Guevarra himself are now open for us. This must be kept top secret and only to be acknowledged by a selective few, since if it gets out, the militarists and the public will surely riot. Now, may our talks begin."
ACR_combined_efforts_desc:0 "As our nations continue cooperating, Marques has proposed that the Acrean army and the Revolutionary force make joint military exercises and economic aid, a idea that many will vote against, but with the right incentives, the deal will be passed, and our nations shall make further cooperation."
ACR_talk_business_desc:0 "Now that we have finally proven to be noteworthy for the ERN, they are slowly opening up for us. But in order to be considered loyal to them for future cooperation, we need to do some tasks that it presents to us. These kinds of ''favors'' could range for a variety of things that we don't have knowledge of, but should we continue being friends with Che, they are a necessity."
ACR_keep_relationship_professional_desc:0 "Now that our efforts have payed off, we have finally been rewarded. Substantial military help is coming from the south and is coming fast. Che has sent us manpower and guns to help in the defense of the republic, and now we are ready for any kind of threat. We are not afraid to shoot strangers anymore!"
ACR_holding_hands_with_che_desc:0 "As part of our continues effort of maintaining good relations, Che has said on radio that he will send one of his most trusted advisors to be his representative for future agreements. Great news, since this will mean faster and greater opportunities for collaboration with them. meanwhile, as always, being the ones benefiting on the end of the bargain."
ACR_ask_for_a_kiss_desc:0 "We have reached a point that we could now ask for more closer or personal with our relationship with Marques and Che, with that being to establish trade and trade routes with the ERN. We will convince and request permission with his advisor and wait for a response by the other party."
ACR_ask_for_permission_to_go_deeper_desc:0 "Now with the trade routes established, we will petition something riskier, which is the access to the ERN rivers and the Madre de Dios river system for further trading opportunities. Our nation debates heavily on their response, some clamming that would be already asking for too much. However, to further our goals and survival, this must go through."
ACR_mutual_love_for_working_class_desc:0 "Oh my, what a wonderful time are we living in. The ERN and Acre's relations are better than ever! We are trading valuable resources between both parties and our worries about them attacking us are basically none! Even the quality of life in our nation has improved, although nobody knows why, and hopefully they all accept that. Marques says that he's making something really special for this occasion for Che, and he is dedicated to it, it may be a poem, considering his background."
ACR_keep_relationship_secret_desc:0 "HIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!!! WHAT WERE THEY THINKING WHEN DOING THIS?!?! The word just got out that the pigs from the executive branch of the republic are dealing with THE GODDAMN REDS!!! The militias are screaming at each other while Cerqueira is cursing at himself, rumor has it that he wants the entire office on the targeting range for simply thinking of such an act!"
ACR_deal_with_parents_against_it_desc:0 "Since the day where we publicly announce our partnership with the ERN our biggest opposition is Cerqueira and his militarists. There will be a meeting with all the senators to discuss further negotiations with Che in which we can hopefully deal and convince the senate to join our side for the Acrean people."
ACR_promises_of_independence_desc:0 "With all the chaos reaching all the sides of the republic, we've finally talked on radio and ended this issue diplomatically. We have settled on a treaty with the ARC as a white peace. This will surely keep Che happy, and we finally get them off our tail after all these years, but the Militarists are mad for not resolving the issue indefinitely and some senators protest for losing valuable land and people to the ERN. Nevertheless, we can deal with all these affairs calmly."
ACR_make_love_not_war_desc:0 "With our independence secured the citizens of Acre can finally relax, knowing that the red devil has hidden his fangs. President Marques however can do one better, give in to the rummors of collaborationism and officially declare Acre as a nation aligned with Che's ideals. This would be highly controversial at least, catastrophic at best, but the option to present this to the senate stands."

ACR_cerqueria_presidency_desc:0 "The ballots are counted and, to everyone's shock, Cerqueira got the majority of the votes. Now in charge of his second term in office, he's prepared to take action on major changes to the state."
ACR_sideline_tappers_desc:0 "With Cerqueira on the stage discussions on the senate floor about the rubber camps, industry and third party sellers, basically anything related to rubber, have halted. Many intellectuals of the nation believe that the president did this so he could silence major rubber producers, and now rumors rooms the nation of nationalization of all industries. What is he planning to do next?"
ACR_arrest_communist_sympathisers_desc:0 "Honesty is a virtue and virtues are something the socialists lack. We can't let these ''people'' free or worse, politically active. There is going to be intense backlash from the Technocrats, since it is where they are the most concentrated, so we need to be quick to silence them before letting the word out."
ACR_arrest_marques_for_reason_desc:0 "Oh Marques, the little commie in our wonderful and democratic republic. We all know he's leaking to the ERN, and if we want to remain in control, we need to take him out of the picture. A night raid will be conducted on his current location and from there, we'll arrest him for siding with the commies. No word should come out of this, we'll put him in somewhere where nobody will ever find."
ACR_forge_charges_against_nationalists_desc:0 "Another big problem are the Acrean nationalists. In order to press our future plans forward, we must condemn this early threat while it is still weak. We will blackmail these senators inside the senate with made up nonsense or personal tastes, threatening to reveal leaks to the press otherwise. And if not, we will arrest them so we can finally get them out of our way."
ACR_assassinate_helio_cury_desc:0 "I never really liked Cury, to be honest. He is just too naive to understand our motives, and his grasp on the Nationalists is just to big to let him live. That's why we must coordinate a assassination for him. Kidnap him unexpectedly and take him to our dungeon, interview for info and after, kill him."
ACR_bosque_correctional_facility_desc:0 "With the facility finally being completed, we can finally put in it the enemies and antagonists of the people or anyone who tries to go against our rule. And with it's minimal exposure and far off Rio Branco, we can relax that these criminals are distant from the political center of our nation, as they can't ever escape to try and overthrow us."
ACR_hostile_takeover_of_rubber_trade_desc:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures. We cannot relay in the same system that lead to the fall of civilization, which leaves us with no other option then nationalize every single private property in the state, there will be resistance, but that is when the army comes to play. The ones that do not agree with our terms will be shot and disposed. We must be the lion in the cat versus mouse game."
ACR_all_money_to_military_desc:0 "Do people know what happened in the world? Do they know what horrors the reds brought upon the US, Cuba or Brazil? And can we all agree that they will come for us next? That's why Cerqueira decided to put almost all of our budget into the army, so we can prevent and rise upon the ashes as the people who survived the world burning, and set off as a new and independent empire."
ACR_prove_our_worth_desc:0 "We don't need any help, and we will prove it. We may be undersupplied, underequiped and inexperienced but we will take this fight head-on with the abomination that is the ERN. We'll prove to the Junta and ERN alike that Acre isn't just some piece of land made only so it can be forgotten. Lord have mercy on us."
ACR_depend_on_greater_state_desc:0 "The Facts are on the table, and we cannot deny its existence: The ERN is military superior to us. If we want to take this snake head-on, it would require help from a third party, the Brazilian Military Junta. Some say this would be a mistake, aligning to Junta and putting us in their sphere of influence, but they are also enemies of the state, so why we should care?"
ACR_force_discipline_in_militias_desc:0 "In order to advance and prepare our military for greater conflicts that may happen sooner or later, we are going to entirely rewrite it into a proper and skilled army. We are taking as reference the traditional Brazilian military structure that will pack a punch harder than any militia could ever dream. We have seen it working on the field with great results, and surely will help us tremendously in our future wars."
ACR_emergency_army_reforms_desc:0 "With all intents and purposes, war is soon inevitable, and we are going to win that, we all agree that we need more major changes to our corps. The army needs to be reeducated with higher knowledge of the battlefield that may turn the tides, and with it, everyone will be benefited by this: the senators, the people and Cerqueira."
ACR_renew_officer_staff_desc:0 "Cerqueira just announced the complete renewed generals that came from the coast, substituting our current ones with Brazilian officers. This is good news, since the current directors were inexperienced in the art of warfare, sure, but many people in our nation can't give in to the fact that they might still be good to keep around."
ACR_makeshift_army_desc:0 "To say we need the Junta is an understatement; we NEED to become the Junta. If our selves want to mean anything to them, we need to make their military staff, their way of governing and thinking identical to ours. Cerqueira is rolling out major reforms with all of it in mind, but many of our senators state that such changes demand such supply that Acre does not have. The impact of this change is one that only time will tell."
ACR_cut_ties_with_outside_world_desc:0 "To become significant to the junta, sacrifices are to be made, the one meaning the end of all diplomatic relations with all other breakaway nations that followed the Brazilian Civil War. With one exception being the Military Junta, of course. Will we lose some friends? Yes. Nevertheless, in the end it will be worth it, since we are bound to rise on the food chain of Amazonas and be its Apex Predator."
ACR_reach_out_to_junta_desc:0 "Finally, with all reforms completed, it is time to contact and begin close relations with the BMJ. It took us a lot of hard work to get us where we are now and we are not going to waste it. We will ask for men, supplies, or to simply put it, their support for fighting the ERN. There is no going back after this, so from now on we are bound to be walking a thin line: keep the balance."
ACR_acre_exists_desc:0 "''...AND WE ARE ITS PEOPLE! THERE IS A DEMON IN THE OUR WOODS, IT IS THE DEMON THAT DESCENDED THE GLOBE IN NUCLEAR FIRE, AND IT WILL NOT STOP UNTIL IT CONQUERS ALL OF WHAT'S LEFT, SO HE CAN CONDEMN US AGAIN INTO MORE SUFFERING. WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS. BE OUR MIND AND SWORD, SO WE WILL BE YOUR BODY AND SHIELD! GIVE US A TASK AND WILL FULFILL IT! DEATH TO THE ERN! GLORY FOR ACRE AND THE JUNTA!''"
ACR_joao_get_your_gun_desc:0 "Acre is not the most populated place in the Amazon, even when Brazil was still united, and this is a problem. But our army needs all the manpower we can get for our goals to be achieved, so a conscription law shall be enacted to make up for it. All adults serve, so grab your rifle soldier, and welcome to the Army!"
ACR_anti_bolivian_sentiment_desc:0 "Now with the Junta's backing, we are slowly starting to force the propaganda into everyday life. Firstly being the posters of the Bolivian menace, and as time passes we will begin television shows, school plays, use The Gazeta do Acre and other major news outlets into publishing the horrors and Dangers of Communism and so on. Given time the people will think that we are at the moral high ground and soon after that."
ACR_hide_our_true_colours_desc:0 "Our senators are pathetic and foolish. What have they ever done? What have they ever proposed that wasn't against our people's intentions? What are their true motives that they intentionally hide? With all said above, this can't go on like this. We need to overthrow the republic. The militarists already are working on possible ways on how we can do it, but for now, we play along their game."
ACR_give_seats_to_former_military_desc:0 "We have struck gold and bound together a plan. Were going to replace the current security guards of the congress chamber with Nabor Junior and Jose Guiomard, Two of Cerqueira closest allies, in the company of their jingoists, and strike the senate while in session. We'll demand the recession of all the senators that don't support our cause and replace them with our nationalists."
ACR_national_conscription_act_desc:0 "With the power currently grasped in our hands, we can finally start the preparations for the inativable war against the ERN. The National Conscription Act will increase the maximum age and turn down the requirements needed for a conscription to the army. With it passed, we can start preparing a capable and sizable army to fight the red menace, this will surpass the guerrilla tactics that they foolishly use."
ACR_national_rearment_act_desc:0 "Now we are doing something that many people, influential or not, are going to see as absurd, which is a new law that gives the government constitutional rights to disarm all civilians and tappers, with the intention to give these guns to the state in an effort to strengthen the army. This will be certainly be seen as a violation to the rights of all, damage our stability and war support, but orders are orders."
ACR_force_a_stage_of_siege_desc:0 "Going another step further, Cerqueira is now calling all the people in our government to declare a state of emergency, reason being the increasing presence of Che and the ERN in our borders, saying also that they are planning to strike soon enough. Many of us think that he's outright creating tension on purpose, since there's not a single report reporting increasing activity there."
ACR_show_our_true_colours_desc:0 "We are ready. We are ready to reveal who we truly are. Our plans, motives and hearts will be revealed to the public. We are tiring of hiding ourselves from the spotlight and being the puppet of the republic for so long, and being a lap dog is outrageous. After this, there is now going back. We also don't know what the general opinion will be, so be prepared for unforeseen consequences."
ACR_siege_senate_desc:0 "Time to react, and fast. We are going to strike the senate for the second time, with the twist being that we're going to tear down the republic and replace it with a government loyal to the Junta. Cerqueira's followers, supporters and Brazilian nationalists will siege the congress chamber and declare, as Cerqueira said himself, that the Acrean republic is illegitimate."
ACR_strip_land_of_men_desc:0 "We need an army, and if we want to stand a chance against Che and his goons we will go overboard with our conscription requirements. Lower them, and pump up the maximum age! Conscript the homeless, the poor and the undesirables! Make the population see reason, and destroy any and all defiants! Do anything but above all else give the army more men!"
ACR_tappers_no_desc:0 "Our ever growing and powerful army will need it's increasing demand for more men, and we've found the perfect candidates. The rubber fields are, in our eyes, a waste of resources that could be relocated for more important subjects. We are conscripting their workers into the troops, all of them. In the past the rubber fields we're important to our economy, now no more. With this, we're surely beating anything the world can throw at us..."
ACR_soldiers_desc:0 "…and even more! Heck we could say we have the best army in the amazon! Che and any fool will fear us! Long live Cerqueira and our beloved homeland with all its glory!"
ACR_jail_opposition_desc:0 "This will become a big problem if not dealt soon. Many ex-senators from the old republic are broadcasting live on radio, telling the people of our nation to ''not give up'' and a bunch of other nonsense. Cerqueira has given us orders to shut down and burn the stations to the ground. And finally label these people as terrorists, to make them think twice before contradict our rule."
ACR_erase_acrean_nationalism_desc:0 "Brazil is not lost. It's alive and breathing, but nevertheless it's struggling. Some think it is dead and we were one of those people, but now we've changed. Now it's the time to toss aside foolish ideas of independence and reunite under the Brazilian flag with all its glory. We are the people of Acre, but we will be forever Brazilians."
ACR_join_war_desc:0 "With all war preparations clear and wanting for orders, we can now firmly join the struggle on reuniting all of Brazil. This will be difficult but the Junta has assured us that they will provide any request we have to make. Our military staff is pretty confident that we can handle anything the jungle throws at us, To arms! We are the heroes! For Brazil!"
ACR_refuse_constitution_desc:0 "To know that we still use the old republic's constitution is something really worrying, because why? Why do we have such a mess that defines what we must obey and not to do? It has so many flaws that don't allow us to do what everyone thinks it's right? With all said, we're going to rewrite this and make a brand new one. it will take some time but it needs to be much better than the old one."
ACR_embrace_brazil_desc:0 "Oh yes, the Brazilian constitution. It 's so right, like everything on it, we could even say it's perfect. Our nation has every piece set up in place, like a chessboard, to rightfully adopt and use it, we just need some sewell time to make sure we don't do anything wrong and that no one tries to stop it."
ACR_acrean_military_command_desc:0 "We've gone through so many changes in such little time. We've gone to a tyrant republic to our proud dictatorship, people see us as heroes for standing out for them, fighting for them, and hopefully this will be the last one in a long time: Just a simple name change, to represent what we've become now."
ACR_acre_ameo_desc:0 "Finally, after all this time, of preparation, coordination and rehabilitation of the army, we are ready. We are ready for what we set out to achieve of what we planned since the beginning, and with the junta support, we are sure more capable enough to defeat this demon. Che must be ready, because we are here, sound and preparable, just wanting to sound the drums of war."
