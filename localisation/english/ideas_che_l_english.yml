che_ideas_a_dream_of_revolution_desc:0 "The ERN is meant to be much more then your run-of-the-mill army of unwashed guerrilheiros, it is the first step of the greatest dream a man could have. That of the liberation of all peoples of the world from the shackles of Capitalism. From the shores of Ushuaia to the ruins of Anchorage, all oppressed souls of the American continent must be freed by the hand of Marx, and Guevara is his most loyal missionary. Or martyr. "

che_ideas_magnetic_personality_desc:0 "Che’s survival when the bombs dropped was nothing short of a miracle, how unfitting that the man who martyrized Cuba didn’t get the same fate. What follows are legends, some say he swam from Cuba to Venezuela and tracked all the way across and the jungle the Andes to Bolivia, or that he sailed up the Amazon river on a stolen boat, taking with him refugees that became his first followers. Whatever the truth is Che’s fame precedes him, his bad boy persona mixing with that of an unkillable guerrilla fighter, making so tens of men and women flock to his banner every month to bask on his glory and serve his cause. "

che_ideas_overextended_and_disorganized_desc:0 "So far the ERN has accomplished… little of value. Che can call himself the God Emperor of Communism all he wants but in reality he commands miles upon miles of dense jungle and an army of untrained teenagers, many times believing on conflicting flavors of Communism. Consistently beaten back on expansion attempts, the excitement Che produces on his followers fades fast when confronted with reality, and those cracks will start to show very quickly if a real victory is not achieved soon."
