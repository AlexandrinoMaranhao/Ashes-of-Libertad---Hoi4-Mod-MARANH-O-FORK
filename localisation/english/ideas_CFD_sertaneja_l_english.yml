CFD_the_peasant_leagues_desc:0 "The peasants' leagues are groups of PCB-Aligned members who fight for the many plights of the rural population of the sertão. Although they helped us during the fight against the 6th Military Region, their high level of involvement led to their influence greatly expanding, and the government has no effective way of reducing their grip. Their main goal is enacting the agrarian reform, but that is a very unpopular word with the rich ''coronéis'', meaning we must deal with them in the most cautious way possible."

CFD_turbulent_confederatization_desc:0 "Due to the turbulent formation of the confederacy, we lack basic structure like an official set of laws and many institutions expected from an independent nation like the one we break apart of. Brazil’s 1946 constitution is the only thing we have left from a proper organization of our own, perhaps, tweaking it, we can make a good use out of it."

CFD_the_gateway_to_south_america_desc:0 "Similar to the initial days of Portuguese colonization, port cities like Recife receive a rain of european migrants seeking a better life, although the first time around there was no nuclear hellfire involved."

CFD_disunited_armed_forces_desc:0 "After the deportation attempt made by the §O6th Military Region§! led us to a complete lack of standardization of our army. Most Pro-Junta forces left during the conflict, and those who remained with us were disorganized militia formations and some PMPE remnants, which now comprise our army. The order is maintained by the many independent militia groups that have pledged support for our cause, the problem is, that some leaders of these groups range from radical socialists to catholic reactionaries, and the aggressions between these groups are very common to occur…"

CFD_the_sergipe_backstab_desc:0 "Sergipe was once one of the northeastern states that rose up against the illegitimate military government and joined the confederacy, but their opportunist leader decided to leave us in a time of great strife of our newborn nation. They must be dealt with, and brought back again into the fold."
CFD_piratas_de_noronha:0 "Piratas de Noronha"
CFD_piratas_de_noronha_desc:0 "The island of Fernando de Noronha is one of the greatest pains the confederacy has, but can’t, deal with. Since Arraes escaped from the island and the collapse of the §O6th Military Region§!, all contact the military had with the island was effectively cut, and although it is not known exactly what the soldiers are doing there now, everything indicates that they had to resort to banditism to survive. Convoys with refugees from Europe and fisher boats are being constantly harassed, and it seems like they still have the confederacy as their main target, although they may have gone too far to ever be admitted back to any military…"
