CFD_the_peasant_leagues:0 "The Peasant Leagues"
CFD_the_peasant_leagues_desc:0 "The §RPeasant Leagues§! are groups of §RPCB§!-Aligned members who fight for the many plights of the rural population of the sertão. Although they helped us during the fight against the §O6th Military Region§!, their high level of involvement led to their influence greatly expanding, and the government has no effective way of reducing their grip. Their main goal is enacting Land reform, a very unpopular idea to the rich ''coronéis'' and land owners of the Confederacy, meaning we must deal with them in the most cautious way possible."

CFD_turbulent_confederatization:0 "Turbulent Confederatization"
CFD_turbulent_confederatization_desc:0 "Due to the turbulent formation of the Confederacy, we lack basic structures, most pressingly, an official set of laws and many institutions expected of an independent nation like the one we parted with, §GBrazil’s 1946 Constitution§! may be the only thing we have left as a legitimate legal code, tweaking it, perhaps, we could make good use out of it."

CFD_the_gateway_to_south_america_desc:0 "Similar to the initial days of Portuguese colonization, port cities like §ORecife§! receive a rain of incoming European migrants seeking a better life, although the first time around, there was no nuclear hellfire involved."
CFD_disunited_armed_forces:0 "Disunited Armed Forces"
CFD_disunited_armed_forces_desc:0 "After the attempted deportation of the prior legitimate governments in the northeast made by the §O6th Military Region§!, our so-called army has been left a disorganized mess. Most of the Brazillian armed forces, who were §OPro-Junta§!, left during the conflict, so what remained with us were unstandardized militia formations and some §BPMPE§! (Pernambuco's Military Police) remnants, which now comprise our army. Order is maintained by the many independent militia groups that have pledged support for our cause, the issue is, that the leaders of these groups can range from radical socialists to catholic reactionaries, and violence between these groups is very likely to occur…"
CFD_the_sergipe_backstab:0 "The Sergipe Backstab"
CFD_the_sergipe_backstab_desc:0 "§YSergipe§! was once one of the northeastern states that rose up against the illegitimate military government and joined the confederacy, but its opportunistic leader decided to leave it in a time of great strife in our newborn nation. They must be dealt with and brought back again into the fold."
CFD_piratas_de_noronha:0 "Piratas de Noronha"
CFD_piratas_de_noronha_desc:0 "The island of §OFernando de Noronha§! is one of the greatest pains the confederacy has, but can’t deal with. Since Arraes escaped from the island-prision, the collapse of the §ONortheastern Military Command§! and expulsion of the §O6th Military Region§!, all contact the Junta had with the island was effectively cut leaving it as the sole remnant of this former branch of the Brazilian Military, and although it is not known precisely what the soldiers are doing there now, everything indicates that they have resorted to banditry to survive. Convoys with refugees from Europe and fishing trawlers are constantly harassed, they also seem to still have the confederacy as their main target, even so, they may have gone too far to ever be admitted back to any military force…"
CFD_aftermath_of_the_great_1962_famine:0 "Aftermath of the Great 1962 Famine"
CFD_aftermath_of_the_great_1962_famine_desc:0 "The collapse of the international market made it so that the economy of the northeastern states, deeply dependent on sugar export, broke immediately. The neglect of welfare during the Junta administration gave our population deep scars, and although the worst parts of the §Rfamine§! have been contained, there is still a general sentiment of austerity and poverty that permiates the whole of the Northeast."
CFD_barterbased_economy:0 "Barter-Based Economy"
CFD_barterbased_economy_desc:0 "Even if the expulsion of the Junta administration from the northeast was the right thing to do, it, unfortunately, made us regress in many ways, one of them was the end of an organized banking system, which led us to lack of an official currency and a comeback of a barter economy. Although this isn't the doom of the confederation, it greatly hampers our economic growth and must be dealt with as soon as possible."

CFD_unhappy_population_desc:0 "§YSergipe§! is an area that has very prominent influence from the §YPraieiro Movement§!, and members of the said movement are all outraged at the fact that Dória split away from the confederacy. Although they are not in open revolt, riots and public shows of disobedience are common, and each day that passes Dória's rule becomes less and less stable."
