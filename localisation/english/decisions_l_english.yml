With Portella's only goal being to restore order to his old home, we must provide the guns and sometimes the manpower necessary to achieve that, otherwise we might lose the best chance we have at increasing the grip of the confederacy and striking the anarchists that harass our frontier villages constantly. \n\nHow does the §YPiaui Frontier§! works?\n\n§R**§!Each operation takes 7 days to start, and 30 days to end. At the end of each operation the [CFD.GetName] annexes a city of Piauí named on the Operation's decision, the cost of these operations are measured on §GJosé Sarney's§! annoyance towards us. \n§R**§!The ability to use the Piauí Frontier Mechanic depends on §4Portella's health§!, if he gets injured during an operation it will be disabled for a period of 30 days. He may be injured repeatedly up to §Rthree times§!, after that he won't be able to overcome his wounds resulting in his death. With that the Frontier will no longer be available, meaning that §GSarney§! will be free to expand his manor and claim all the remaining land for himself without resistance. \n\nThe safety of the Confederation and the people of the Sertão depends on the Frontier being tamed, losing is not an option. \n\n§Y*Operations' challenge-o-meter*§!\n§GEasy Operations§! - Lightly defended by disorganized militias and loose bands of bandits, these operations don't require much effort, equipment or experience. \n§OMedium Operations§! - Facing larger bands of Cangaceiros, this operations demands a certain level of preparation, good equipment and well trained troops are advised. \n§RHard Operations§! - The North of Piauí is plagued with roaming bands of Cangaceiros, mad Guerrillas and Bloodthirsty Mercenaries, securing the lands around Parnaíba will require preparations to be nothing less than perfect. Survival in these lands hangs on the best guns, most hardened well-trained soldiers and most competent plans we can afford."
