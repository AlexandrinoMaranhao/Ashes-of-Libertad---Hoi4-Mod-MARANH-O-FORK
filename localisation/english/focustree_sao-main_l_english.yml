SAO_extinguish_militarist_hopes_desc:0 "Even with a better cause presented many inside our state dare to support the Junta and their dastardly, pathetic attempt at a coup 'etá! If we don't act quickly tanks from Brasília may just stroll into the Avenida Paulista without an ounce of resistance, celebrated by the people, killing the Revolution before it has a chance to blossom. Tho we can't win all the hearts we can cut the heads of support for them, replacing disloyal police Deputies and municipal leadership types with ones aligned with our cause to ensure their immediate support."
SAO_ashamefulexcuse:0 "...A Shameful Excuse"
SAO_ashamefulexcuse_desc:0 "...pathetic really. Truth be told this was never about democracy, it has always been about the money. Brasília is a marvel of architecture and Rio may be the historical heart of the nation, but any true Paulista knows that they both pale in comparison with the industrial capital of Brazil, the colossal City of Drizzle, São Paulo. With the economy devastated and the war draining men and resources its situation has never been so dire before, something had to be made! The Revolution was the answer found by Governor Adhemar, it is greatest gamble so far, and his new biggest problem."
SAO_the_road_to_guanabara:0 "The Road to Guanabara"
SAO_the_road_to_guanabara_desc:0 "When the coup attempt of 1963 came it was Paulista men who defended Rio de Janeiro, it was our blood that was spilled on the shores of Guanabara 5 years ago, and now war comes to it again. The Second Battle of Guanabara promises to be a turning point in the war, unleashing never before seen bloodshed on Brazil, and we sit right next to it. The Republic pressures us to renounce our neutrality and help them, let supplies in, let men out, they scream and cry desperately wanting us to help them save Rio once again. But São Paulo is not a slave to the Republic no more, we can exchange favors for favors while keeping our neutrality intact, but we won't fight their wars for them."
SAO_thesecondconstitutionalistrevolutionis:0 "The Second Constitutionalist Revolution is..."
SAO_thesecondconstitutionalistrevolutionis_desc:0 "In 1932 when the tyrannical forces of Vargas seized the presidency, the good folk of São Paulo rose in rebellion! From near and far men flocked to the streets, donating all they had in a joined effort to preserve the integrity of democracy and uphold the legitimacy of the Brazilian Constitution. They failed. The Brazilian Caudillo would reign despite the Paulista effort to stop him, but now a chance of redemption showed itself. The heir of Vargas, President João Goulart, dragged our honorable state into a senseless fratricide in the name of democracy, only to, like the tyrant before him, spit in its face. We're not gonna take it!  The 2nd Constitutionalist Revolt is at hand, and this time we will show that it is..."
SAO_anhonorablecause:0 "...An Honorable Cause"
SAO_anhonorablecause_desc:0 "...the rightful path for Brazil. It's just logical, São Paulo is and has been for almost a century the true heart of Brazil, not the newcomer Brasília or god forbid the horrid Porto Alegre. Taking the helm of the nation and steering it back to its right course is nothing but historical correction, if not national salvation from the claws of Castelo Branco and Goulart. As feeble as it is now, the Constitutionalist Revolution inspires its men to be better and to follow the footsteps of their forefathers in the search for a better tomorrow. It is the future of Brazil, like it or not."
SAO_the_paulista_betrayal:0 "The Paulista Betrayal"
SAO_the_paulista_betrayal_desc:0 "When São Paulo declared its late neutrality in the Brazilian Civil War the headlines in the republican newspapers did not read ''Glorious Revolution'' as they should, instead they read ''The Paulista Betrayal''. Our exit from the conflict caused as much desperation in the Republic as it did hope in the Junta, who idiotically believe we'll join their cause. Our exit has not been completely uncontested, Republican troops are still inside our soil and as our Police mobilize themselves a possible conflict is boiling quickly, something neither we nor the Republic can afford so early. Thankfully, we have time to negotiate our neutrality, it all hangs on Guanabara..."
SAO_eye_to_eye_with_the_republic:0 "Eye to Eye with the Republic"
SAO_eye_to_eye_with_the_republic_desc:0 "The Republic is itching for an intervention, with São Paulo out of the Civil War their temporary capital, Rio de Janeiro is isolated and easy picking for the Eastern Military Command. They know however that controlling the City of Drizzle is not an easy task, and retaking it by force at the same time as they fight in Mato Grosso and Rio could overextend their line and spell doom for their resistance. It is a common interest that peace between us remains, for the time being, we just need to control the more hot-headed on both sides to ensure it stays."
SAO_appeasing_the_elites:0 "Appeasing the Elites"
SAO_appeasing_the_elites_desc:0 "The minds behind the Revolution, the Elites of São Paulo range from families sitting on old money from Imperial times to up-and-coming industrialists from before the war. Deep down the Revolution is their interest, their idea, their plan, and if it loses their support then we are all doomed. We must assure them that it will be of their financial benefit to finance our efforts moving forward and that, in the end, their way of life will be upheld as high as the Constitution."
SAO_police_the_border:0 "Police the Border"
SAO_police_the_border_desc:0 "The preservation of the Revolution depends on the integrity of the State, we are surrounded by old and soon-to-be enemies who can easily prey on the outskirts far from the safety of the Metropolis, and we cannot, by principle, allow that. Since the Southeastern Military Command turned into dust our only defense force is the State Police, whom we must mobilize and organize quickly if we want to ensure every little bit of São Paulo is defended."
SAO_the_coffee_and_milk_line:0 "The Coffee and Milk Line"
SAO_the_coffee_and_milk_line_desc:0 "The border between São Paulo and Minas Gerais is troublesome, to say the least. Smuggling is rampant as people come in and out without resistance, Guerrilheiros from the COLINA walk into our state freely, escaping from government persecution and fomenting similar movements inside our borders, and immigrants coming from around the world flock coming from the northeast. If we must defend against one outside enemy then let it be Minas, fortify our border with it, and bring order to this madness."
SAO_the_unsure_revolution:0 "The Unsure Revolution"
SAO_the_unsure_revolution_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, our people remain divided, much because of Adhemar's incapability of committing to the Revolution. Riots and fights break out constantly around the state, and protesters clash against each other while the police try desperately to maintain order and calm in the city squares, repeating the panic that followed the first days of the apocalypse. A way forward must be presented to unify our cause under a solid goal before it all comes crashing down."
SAO_the_public_defence_force:0 "The Public Defence Force"
SAO_the_public_defence_force_desc:0 "Our forces are spread thin, the police are stretched to their limit trying to stop enemies from within and without, if nothing is made soon order in the state will collapse quickly. Immediate reforms must be made, expand recruitment efforts, confiscate weapons and equipment, inspire the people to donate everything from their rings to their cars to finance the security of the state."
SAO_a_army_in_name_only:0 "The Southeastern Military Command"
SAO_a_army_in_name_only_desc:0 "The Southeastern Military Command evaporated into thin air when São Paulo left the Republican cause, its forces melted back into the population or deserted to their preferred side, it now exists purely as a name, an army with no leader, guns, or soldiers. Until now. General Figueiredo will be appointed as the head of the new face of the SEMC, a true Revolutionary Army capable of eventually rivaling the Republic and Junta combined. Or so he promisses."
SAO_resettling_the_immigrants:0 "Urban Hellscape"
SAO_resettling_the_immigrants_desc:0 "Like any other big city in the Americas, São Paulo was built by immigrants from around the world, even after the Apocalypse languages from as far places as Japan and Germany can still be heard in the streets spoken by the sons and daughters of immigrants. When the world ended it became once again the final destination of many dislocated folk, from in and out of Brazil. Dislocated people from the Northeast and failed settlers of devasted Mato Grosso share the dark grimy streets with refugees from Europe and the USA, who tracked all the way down here in search of salvation. It is not a good look to have the streets filled with the homeless and needy while bolstering National Salvation, and if left unchecked these people can very quickly become troublesome or worse, associate themselves with the ALN or other terrorist organizations out of desperation. We can resettle them around the state based on factors such as language and origin, creating new communities and hopefully wining their loyalty if desperate help is ever needed."
SAO_new_neighbors:0 "New Neighbors"
SAO_new_neighbors_desc:0 "The City of São Paulo is big, very big, perhaps the largest in the world, and it keeps on growing. As more and more refugees flock to the city it grows vertically and spreads to the surrounding hills, overcrowded apartments share space with many-leveled buildings made with scrap, connected through bridges and overpasses that turn the ground level into a dark, dystopic nightmare. To keep order a new urban plan must be quickly made to turn the city back into a livable place and new neighborhoods must be founded to keep up with the uncontrollable growth of the city."
SAO_figueiredosreforms:0 "Figueiredo's Reforms"
SAO_figueiredosreforms_desc:0 "General Figueiredo has proved to be a masterful commander and planner, his influence over the Revolutionary Army grows each day inspiring the men and bringing order to the chaos that surrounds us. While the army is improving rapidly the Police have been left in the dust, failing to improve and adapt to the ever more audacious ALN. Figueiredo has offered a solution, the Police will become a branch of the Revolutionary army effectively being put under his command and the leadership of his right hand man, Sérgio Fleury, and new, inventive tactics will be applied and tested to combat the enemies of the state."
SAO_protecting_the_rich:0 "Protecting the Rich"
SAO_protecting_the_rich_desc:0 "The ALN is quickly becoming a major thorn in our side. The influx of weapons from the COLINA has exponentially increased the violence and frequency of their attacks. Their targets are where it hurts us the most, our pockets. The overstretched police cannot dream of protecting every single bank in the state and kidnappings or killings of members of the Paulista elite are increasing in risk every passing day. We have to increase our efforts to protect our coffins or the whole operation will fall apart, even if that means allowing the formation of Militias or Private Security Forces to fill in our gaps."

The names of the martyrs of the original revolution still linger on the minds of the people and new ones are added to the list every day, we can turn this tragedy into motivation. We can turn the presses on our side, revive the old icons, make new posters, write new headlines, publish new manifestos, and forge new heroes."

SAO_the_chest_of_happiness_desc:0 "Even while the country falls into war and famine the Brazilian people can find comfort in a few things, and if you have a television, that comfort is the Silvio Santos Show! The charismatic TV host Silvio Santos rose like a rocket, picking the pieces of what little was left of Brazilian entertainment media and turning it into a monopoly, hosting his show tirelessly every day to millions of watchers doing everything from interviews to War coverage, movies, novellas, kids shows and news. His potential is immense, and with the backing of the Paulista Elite Silvio could become an integral piece in winning the hearts of not only São Paulo but the whole of Brazil."
SAO_family_before_country:0 "Family Problems"
SAO_family_before_country_desc:0 "General Figueiredo is a dedicated man, but a divided one too. His brothers all fight on different fronts for different armies, the Junta, the Republic, and the Revolution, still they all write to and love each other as brothers do. The fear of one day fighting his family in the name of his cause is shared by all of them, and as that inevitable day draws ever near it has come the time to choose between his family and his cause."

SAO_greyskiesoncemore_desc:0 "For the first time in years, the skies over the City of Drizzle are filled with the smog of factory steam and pollution, a truly beautiful sight to behold. With the factories up and running Paulista products are ready to be loaded into armed convoys and escorted out of the city to be sold to whoever wants to buy them. The internal economy of the state is flourishing again, people have plentiful access to food, tools, clothes, luxury goods, electro domestics even! The industrial heart of Brazil is beating again just waiting to send its blood through the arteries of the whole country, but before we can safely sell to the outside world and live our true potential the embargo on São Paulo must be lifted, or bypassed..."

We can't possibly afford to put one police officer on every street corner of the monstrosity that is São Paulo, it is a horrible idea for numerous motives. But what we may be able to do is create a fast response group that can cover a big distance fast, and organizes itself organically by easing communication between faraway units. Lack of resources forces us to start small, officers will be organized in groups of two and given whatever cars and radios we can find, the idea being that once the ALN commits any big operation the officers can report it and organize themselves via radio, in the hopes of catching the terrorists before they can escape and disappear back into the dark city."

Barros' lack of apparent commitment to the Revolution has put his position at risk, his token reforms just aren't enough to satiate the more vigorous revolutionaries, shrewish as always, he's found a solution to this in the form of an only enemy. Jânio Quadros, former president of Brazil, is giving it another go at it, and this might be just what Barros needs to save his ass. Barros will run as Quadros' mate in the elections of the 4th Republic, presenting himself as the ''Candidate of the Revolution'', after all, if he wins the vice-presidency fairly he'll use his position to peacefully fix things and UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION, without necessitating needless bloodshed, putting an end to the ridiculous position he put himself in."

To battle this Figueiredo has been put to the task of finding new ways to counter Marighella's growing influence, identifying his weak points, dismantling his weave of connections and informants, and putting an end to the ALN's shadow over the suburbs of the City of Drizzle."

Besides being presented by the Junta's meek propaganda machine as the perfect soldier to whom all should aspire to be Abreu has long been working with outside forces in order to enrich himself, using his position in the Mineiro Triangle to smuggle goods in and out of the Junta via its rich railroad system. We can take part in this fun, by sending over some weapons for his battalion along with some ''personal gifts'' we can start to change his loyalties towards us and ensure that products made in Paulista factories will fill the shelves of Brasília, Belém, and beyond!"

SAO_sneak_into_the_junta_desc:0 "The investment paid off, quickly, and in more ways than expected. Despite our self-declared neutrality, the Junta based in Brasília has looked to São Paulo with loving eyes ever since the Revolution stripped the state out of the hands of the Republic, this was because of the Paulista people's initial support of the coup. The recent investment in the 36º didn't come unnoticed as we hoped it would, but it ended up being a good thing as now the Junta's opinion of us has increased substantially, as they wrongfully see this as the beginning of closer military cooperation between us. We can capitalize on this happy diplomatic ''incident'' by gaining a bit more time before a military intervention against us happens, giving us precious time to prepare and sort out our own problems before dealing with the lethargic giant that is Brasília."

Asphalt is a rare resource nowadays and hoping to repair the extensive road network in the state during a time of crisis like this would be madness, however, São Paulo like many other places in Brazil has a rich river system that crosses the entirety of the State, weaving communities together and connecting them to the outside world. By expanding critical ports in the capital and up the Tietê River we can easily let commerce flow out of the factories and into the hands of the Paulista people without having to worry too much about infrastructure or the dangers that traveling by land offers, such as ALN ambushes."

The Republic of Argentina seems to be much better off than its northern Lusitan brother, surviving unscathed the apocalypse and thriving more than ever if propaganda is to be believed. By following up the Paraguay River we can reach it, with only the occasional interference of Patrol Boats from the 4th Brazilian Republic, who still embargoes us, but as long as the war in Mato Grosso doesn't escalate this should be easily bypassed by offering bribes to border guards and flying under Paraguayan, Argentinian or Uruguayan colors."
