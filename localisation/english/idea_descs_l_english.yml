 THE_PAULISTA_CATASTROPHE_desc:0 "After years on the fence the apocalypse finally caught up with São Paulo, Adhemar's gamble failed spectacularly, his attempt to escape the devastation of the civil war brought São Paulo to its knees like never before and no hope remains for its people. The sudden deaths of Marighella and Figueiredo left the state headless, and with no food or ammo to carry on fight the armies that just a few months prior clashed in the streets dispersed into nothingness, killed not by bullets, but by hunger. With no cause worth fighting for the Paulista people turn inwards to their deserted communities hoping to preserve what little is left for them, living day after day amidst the ruins of once promising factories and now silent propaganda printers, hopeless and incapable of doing anything but pray for intervention, be it divine or not. \nThe industrial heart of Brazil has stopped beating again, this time forever, and the only sound in the dead streets is now the cold, endless, pouring rain."
 CAI_cangaco_paulista_desc:0 "The sudden influx of weapons, lack of centralized authority and sheer desperation caused the rural interior of the state to devolve into a sickening cycle of violence. Roaming gangs of ''Cangaçeiros'' prey on the depopulated towns and fledgling settlements in a fight for survival, these bandits pose a not-inconsiderable threat to surrounding states but remain divided internally between countless gangs of a couple of dozen men each, carrying out armed robberies on modified vehicles or horseback."
 CSP_DOPS_police_state_desc:0 "The D.O.P.S. continues to do its job, securing Order and Peace at any cost necessary. To live in São Paulo today is to live in fear, one wrong word, one suspicious action, one single dot in the wrong place of a document and you could end up inside an interrogation center, from where people rarely come out, at least not in one piece. Nothing and no one can hide from Fleury inside his feud, his eyes cover every inch of the broken metropolis in the form of informants and propaganda posters, illuminated by searchlights that light up the forever dark sky. "
 CSP_urban_hellscape_desc:0 "São Paulo is an urban abomination. Newborn ruins share space with slums that cover the tops of pre-war buildings, creating infinite levels of absolute poverty interconnected by overpasses and bridges. The scars of the failed Paulista Uprising will be forever visible in the city, and all efforts of societal improvement carried out in secrecy by the ALN have been systematically removed, leaving many already suffering people starving and without access to clean water or energy. The scent of the city can be felt kilometers away, a mix of the putrified soup that the Tietê river has become and the sweat and blood of its inhabitants, washed out by a constant downpour of rain blackened by the smog and soot of fires far away."
 CSP_the_city_of_drizzle_desc:0 "Despite it all, São Paulo carries on living under a new name:\ The City of Drizzle. Immigrants keep on flooding in searching for a long-forgotten dream of opportunity and a few remaining factories keep on pumping out products to feed the needy demand. The State of São Paulo may be dead forever but its namesake city keeps on living despite it all, for god knows how long."

No one knows his identity or why he does what he does, but the Bachelor protects those who cross the jungles and the ruins while passing through Cananea. His existence is to some supernatural, but undeniable, some claim him to be a Guerrilla Fighter seeking redemption for past crimes, hiding in the jungles and punishing the unjust who pass through it, some believe him to be a native legend, the Curupira or Anhangá, others even believe he might be the soul of a long-dead warlord from colonial times still protecting him unlawful domain.

 CDC_the_legacy_of_marighella_desc:0 "Marighella's death meant the end of the ALN as it existed but the poet-warrior managed to leave behind more than just verses. Under the command of Capitan ''Old-Man'' Toledo the ALN lives on in Campinas, far away from the dream of a Brazil free from capitalist tyranny but still capable of doing some change. Marighella's ideals of political freedom, representative democracy and a utopian communist became reality in the Comune of Campinas, defended and upheld by his bible, the MiniHandbook of the Urban Guerilla Fighter."
 CDC_autonomous_comune_desc:0 "The Comune of Campinas is seen by many with hostility despite its somewhat satisfactory living conditions, and so it lives in relative isolation. Quick and effective agricultural reforms kept hunger away from the small comune, and a steady stock of weapons and ammunition remaining from the Uprising ensures its safety in such a chaotic world."
 BAR_festa_de_rodeio_desc:0 "Who doesn't love rodeo? People just can't help but to go see the array of attractions and bull shows set up in Barretos, a much-needed distraction for those who can afford it. Fulled by regional turism, the City of Barretos lives on almost unscathed, ruled by the King of Cattle, Mounter of Bulls, Destroyer of Horns himself, Osmar Marchi. It exists as a beacon of joy and rest in an unforgiving wasteland of São Paulo, where the common man after a month's work can rest his tools and gather together around a fire, crack a cold one with his friends, eat some churrasco, listen to a nice guitar and see someone get fucked up by a bull."

 TYW_the_yellow_woodpeckers_desc:0 "Taking their name from the childhood classic ''Sitio do Pica-Pau Amarelo'', or ''The Yellow Woodpecker's Farmstead'', this mercenary band from Taubaté stomps of the legacy of Lobato. Formed during the Constitutionalist Revolution as a private security force they are employed to great extent by Carlos Walter Marinho, whom they charmingly nicknamed ''O Visconde de Sabugosa'' after the book's corny viscount. Their relationship is symbiotic, and while not necessarily evil, the Yellow Woodpeckers have become known for carrying out their master's will with little hesitation and great efficiency whatever the task may be."
 TYW_unfertile_land_desc:0 "Centuries of coffee growing left the lands of the once-thriving Coffee Valley dry and empty, devasted by the lack of care to its fields after and during the Constitutionalist Revolution and climatic changes brought by Nuclear Winters.

 ROT_e_rota_na_rua_desc:0 "The ROTA is an honorable institution, dedicated to the service and protection of the people of São Paulo, and it will forever be it. Departing from the Fortress of Light, armored cars travel around the state carrying out their sacred duty of protecting the innocent from evil, tyranny, oppression, and criminality. No matter where in the state you are you can always smile at the sight of a lonely Veraneio approaching on the distant highway, bringing to you much-needed help in the form of a hardened, lonely Road Warrior."
 ROT_a_fortaleza_da_luz_desc:0 "The ROTA's Headquarters, the Fortress of Light stands as a monument to freedom and law in the dreadful landscape of São Paulo. Armed to the teeth, this police bastion acts as a true medieval castle always ready to repel any attack thrown against it and capable of hosting, supplying, and equipping the dozens of battalions and special forces that form the ROTA."
 UBA_the_railroad_master_desc:0 "Hugo surely had an interesting life. From Pracinha to Poster-Boy, to Traitor to Duke, still, it was a well enjoyed one. When the Constitutionalist Revolution burst into flames and sank into the swamp Hugo was ready to act, retreating his ever-loyal 36º Regiment back to the Mineiro Triangle and establishing control over the railroads leading to it, now, he can just sit back and relax as he finally is his own master. Not under the Junta or São Paulo Hugo can make full use of the fortunes acquired in his years of service, reading fanmail while sipping martinis like a true Railway King."
 PIR_uniao_piracatu_desc:0 "When the end finally came it seemed to spell doom for Botucatu and Piracicaba, seemingly destined to join Sorocaba and other rural communities in their gruesome, bloody fate. Salvation however came in the form of the Piracicaba Minutemen, who lent a hand to the menaced city of Botucatu, saving it from the claws of savagery. Now the cities live in a symbiotic relationship, taking advantage of Botucatu's air facilities to export sugar and corn grown in Piracicaba to far away states, helping to keep the two communities alive and civilized in the face of desperation in a redneck version of the Berlin Air-Lift"
 PIR_piracicaba_minutemen_desc:0 "Led by the charismatic community figure turned Militiaman Antonio Danelon, the Piracicaba Minuteman act as a shield of civility in the region, protecting it fiercely from outside oppression. Boosting about his short time in the army the blue-eyed leader made quick work of turning his militia into a makeshift Rota, using modified civilian vehicles and small aircraft to reach needy communities at a minute's notice, something every proud member swears to do. Still, the Piracicaba Minutemen's numbers are small and equipment is scarce, old, and hard to maintain, often having to resort to makeshift weaponry and jerry rigs to keep much needed guns and vehicles in workable condition."
 PIR_aerial_lifestyle_desc:0 "Botucatu became an aerial hub during the time of the Constitutionalist Revolution, and that legacy lives on. An aviator himself, Danelon makes great use of Botucatu's great airfields and aerial facilities, using airplanes for everything from reconnaissance to trade, transport, and communication. The same can be said for many in their ranks who now spend more time with their head up in the clouds than on the ground, leading to ever more creative ways to keep their planes working; paper-mache for wing repairs, car engines for spare parts, vegetable oil for fuel, everything goes as long as it makes them high!

Those factories now lie dormant, the plantations barren and useless, and the people are more desperate than ever before.

Some of the most notable of these tribes are the Mebêngôkre, Rikbaktsa, and the Aripuanã Macaws. All three tribes are skilled hunters and share a common enemy, the whites.

During the rainy season, The Zo'é stops to grow cassava on small plantations. When the harvest is over, the tribe moves locations and begin cultivation again.The Zo'é paint themselves red with black designs, whilst leaving their faces clear. The most defining features of the Zo'é are the cylindrical ornaments in their lower lips known as “poturu”. Made from the bones of monkey legs, the poturu is a Zo'é tradition that represents a rite of passage and a signifier of their ethnicity.

While it might seem that these people are just as isolated as they are from “civilization” that is far from the case. Kidnappings, murder, and war is all too common. A couple of those who have distinguished themselves are the Korubo, who are known for their frequent use of war clubs and poisonous blow darts ; and the Matsés, who regularly raid villages, killing all the men and abducting the women. In the 1920s, the Matsés managed to acquire firearms and were trained to use them by a woman they had abducted from Peru.

The history of contact between white explorers and the indigenous  started honest with occasional trading of metal tools for exotic plants thought to have medicinal purposes. However, this relationship soured during the Amazon rubber boom and led to a vicious cycle of bloodshed, slavery, and fear.

During the rubber boom, the land and people of Biá were left relatively undisturbed, this is due to the low quality of latex from the trees in this area, making it an unprofitable location to pillage and plunder. Native to Biá are the Tükuna, a nomadic tribe who adopted the ethonym “Kutakina” as this term implied they were a “docile” tribe rather than a “rebel” one by whites. In the 1940s, a tribe of the Kanamari people also settled in Biá as refugees, escaping from either rubber barons or another warring tribe. The tribes of Biá have had much more interactions with the outside world than their neighbors.

Yanomami religion is shamanic, with shamans using “yakoana”, a power hallucinogen that is snorted through the nose which is used for spiritual healing and communicating with their gods.  Around 15 to 25 thousand Yanomami, incorporating several hundred villages, populated this area, spanning across the border of northern Brazil and southeastern Venezuela.

Agriculture is so important to the Waiãpi that they have seasonal ceremonies related to the foods they eat (corn, fish, and honey) and the creation of humanity. Waiãpi interaction with the outside world started in the 1700s, defending their land from French Jesuits and Old World diseases ravaging their population. Without a unifying leader of their people and the fact that their native lands are upon rich quantities of precious minerals, the Waiãpi may be uprooted like a cassava and their lands harvested for profit"

The most unique woven goods they produce are the straw gloves woven and adorned with macaw and hawk feathers that are used in their rite of passage festival where Sateré-Mawé boys stick their hands into the gloves that are woven with ants of the genus paraponera clavata. The boys endure the stinging of the ants for minutes while performing a ritualistic dance as their body succumbs to the neurotoxins.The Sateré-Mawé were the first people to cultivate guaraná, a powerful stimulant richer in caffeine than coffee beans.

Marriages in the tribe are restricted to between the two groups and not within them.Their religion is one of shamanic cosmology and they believe in a divine relationship with all things living and nonliving with the Cosmos.  The Munduruku custom of warfare is related to the practice of taking their enemies heads as trophies, which are then embalmed and thought to possess magical properties that appease the Munduruku’s “Mother of the Hunt'' in hopes of being blessed with good game.

The Deni tribes also suffered greatly from their first contact with the white explorers; the diseases brought to the Deni decimated the population which led to the disorganization of the people and caused a crisis amongst the Deni tribes. The Deni people are expert hunters and fishermen, relying mainly on game as their main food source. In the Deni religion, it is believed that the shaman’s can speak to the spirits and the deceased to determine causes of death. Today, the Deni remain much more vulnerable from the outside world.

The Waimiri-Atroari rely heavily on fishing for their dietary needs and believe that an underwater entity known as the Xiriminja gives them the ability to make tools for this trade. Alongside their Waimiri brothers, the Atroari have defended their territory for generations against hostile tribes and the encroaching grip of missionaries, rubber barons, and the Brazilian government. With bow and arrow, spear and club, tooth and nail; the Atroari alongside their Waimiri brothers face the new world and the threat of outsiders and the resurgence of the living dead."
 tappers_desc:0 "The 3rd Rubber Boom brought life once again to the Amazon, with immigrants from around Brazil settling in the dense jungle trying to make their fortune from the rich Rubber trade, this sudden influx of people however is a major disruption in the delicate ecosystem of the Amazon rainforest and its native people, undisturbed for millions of years. Without government regulations and motivated by the promise of fortune these tappers, loggers and gold diggers plunder and destroy in search of their promised wealth bringing much harm to the Amazon’s native residents."
 fonte_boa_influence_desc:0 "Native life is a communal one, tribes live in close family bonds where all is shared amongst residents, from food gathered during hunts to weapons, tools, houses and in some cases even wifes. Cooperation is what kept these people alive and prospering for hundreds of years, it is no surprise that this way of living would fit so well with Marxist ideals, and that the naive natives would be slowly influenced by them as contact and cooperation with the former §RAraguaia Guerrilla§! fighters increases, while they may not fully understand the scope of the revolution or the concept of bourgeoisie and class struggle the gifts of firearms, medicine and modernization brought by the rebels is enough to turn these naive people into warriors for the revolution."
 displaced_tribe_desc:0 "Tribal wars and the White man sometimes results in a tribe getting displaced from its ancestral home, being forced to leave behind it’s sacred places, hunting grounds and having to change its way of living in order to survive, while the fate of such tribes is unknown one thing is always certain, the will to return home always lives strong in these people’s hearts."
 waimiri_atroari_desc:0 "The Waimiri and Atroari share close bonds, so close as to being considered one single tribe by some researchers, what unites them the most however is the hatred for the white invaders that rape their land from it’s riches. This small confederation of natives stands as a formidable force to lone explorers and settlers trying to make a living in the northern Amazon, being known for their ferocity and sometimes extreme brutality."
 staunch_isolationists_desc:0 "Contact with the white man is not always welcomed with open arms, although it can bring improvements to the native’s way of living being “civilized” normally only brings suffering to the tribes, who are branded as second class citizens, exploited by being forced to work exhausting jobs for minimal pay and ultimately destroying their traditional way of living. Be it for these reasons or a simple disliking and untrusting of the white man some tribes wish to remain isolated and will fight to protect its own interests."
 uncontacted_desc:0 "The Amazon is full of mysteries, and events as big as the Nuclear Apocalypse are unnoticed by some of its more secluded residents, in the deep jungles there are still communities of people who are unaware of the existence of the white man or any of its struggles."
 unnexplored_land_desc:0 "The exploration efforts of the Amazon done in the late 19th and early 20th century came to an abrupt end with the outbreak of Nuclear and Civil war, exploration efforts are largely ignored by every major state, them being distracted with bigger problems, and much of what was already known was lost as academics died out or stopped performing their activities and maps or documents got lost in the flames of war, leaving much of the Amazon a mystery."
 civilized_desc:0 "Not all natives rejected the white man, either forcibly or by their own will they adopted the white man’s ways and abandoned their old ones, although it varies from place to place these people are in theory Brazilian citizens with all the rights that come with it, being largely catholic and portuguese speaking. However, with the cultural change many came to live in poverty when compared to Western standards and are exploited and treated as second class citizens."
 tribal_wars_desc:0 "Unbeknownst to the white man and the greater Brazilian state the isolated tribes of the Amazon regularly partake in tribal warfare, some going as far as to consider this as a fundamental part of their cultural identity. Although these conflicts have few casualties due to the lack of technology of the tribes they sometimes end in the death of experienced warriors or influential tribe members, destruction of precious resources or forced displacement of the losing tribe."
 military_oppression_desc:0 "In these troubling times order has become a priority to militaries in all sides of the conflict, and many tribes became targets under the sights of the jackboot, minor violations receive disproportionately large punishments, military brutality is rampant and tribal life is abruptly forced to end, dismantled and dismembered by the army in an effort to keep peace at all costs."
 loggers_desc:0 "The 11th Parallel Massacre was an act of indescribable and unpunished evil and violence, in 1963 the Rubber extracting firm Arruda, Junqueira & Co organized, payed and executed the largest massacre in an ongoing genocide of Native Americans. While attempting to remove a settlement of natives of the Cinta Larga ethnicity in the headwaters of the Aripuanã river dynamite was dropped off a monoplane into the village before it being invaded by machine gun armed mercenaries, of the more than 3500 people living there only 2 escaped with their lives, amongst the atrocities committed there was the mutilation and exposing of bodies as a warning to other native communities, no punishment came to Arruda, Junqueira & Co from the government, who some say sponsored and keep on sponsoring the ongoing genocide.\n\n§RThis is a footnote in the history of the native’s suffering.§!"
 native_white_cooperation_desc:0 "As the central government collapsed many riverside communities came to depend on the land to survive, to do so new ties were formed with the natives that dwell deeper in the jungle, in a symbiotic self-sustaining relationship allowing both parties to coexist in relative peace without the presence of the Brazilian government."
 neblina_exploited_desc:0 "The Neblina are not just guns for hire at Manaus’s disposal, they are a nightmare for anyone in their reach. Incapable of sustaining their own they pillage and exploit those near to them, demanding tribute or outright sacking, pillaging and massacring entire communities in search of supplies and able-bodied men to sell in the Manauan Market as ‘’Servants’’."
 the_acrean_constitution_desc:0 "There is no state without laws, there is no law without organisation. Therefore, we all agree we must have a constitution. From our ways to enforce laws to our most high ideals, the constitution is written to represent and protect the Acrean people."
 ACR_rio_branco_academy_desc:0 "With some exceptions, every political group agrees that education is fundamental to a country. Of course educating a people is not easy… but we are not a weak nation, after our efforts, we have completed the construction of a great university in Rio Branco."
 ACR_placidos_dream_desc:0 "Two decades ago it would be impossible to imagine a modernized, industrialized Acre. Even with our independence, some doubted that we would do what we did and arrived where we are. We already survived more than the old and idealist Independent State of Acre, we know about how great our country is, and how great it can be."
 ACR_cassinos_rio_branco_desc:0 "To some, money is an amusement, a vicious game, and those are willing to spend it in casinos. And for us, the revival of casinos can help us get resources to develop our nation. Even so, we must not forget the problems that casinos can bring… but anyway, it is now a fact, the lights of this underworld shiny in our capital."
 CAY_famine_fever_fear_desc:0 "Famine, fever, and fear are the three pillars that define everyday life in French Guiana. Without a France to bring them food and barely any fertile land, the people have been subject to food shortages which have killed thousands. The government rules with an iron fist as people’s basic human rights vanished. Disease sits on it poisonous throne in Cheyenne as poverty increases in the city. \n\n§RThe current state of Guiana is one of suffering and oppression. A nation of horror and a dark reminder of what happened 5 years ago.§!"
 a_dream_of_revolution_desc:0 "The ERN is meant to be much more than your run-of-the-mill army of unwashed guerrilheiros, it is the first step of the greatest dream a man could have. That of the liberation of all peoples of the world from the shackles of Capitalism. From the shores of Ushuaia to the ruins of Anchorage, all oppressed souls of the American continent must be freed by the hand of Marx, and Guevara is his most loyal missionary. Or martyr."
 magnetic_personality_desc:0 "Che’s survival when the bombs dropped was nothing short of a miracle, how unfitting that the man who martyrized Cuba didn’t get the same fate. What follows are legends, some say he swam from Cuba to Venezuela and tracked across the jungle the Andes to Bolivia, or that he sailed up the Amazon river on a stolen boat, taking with him refugees that became his first followers. Whatever the truth is Che’s fame precedes him, his bad-boy persona mixing with that of an unkillable guerrilla fighter, making so tens of men and women flock to his banner every month to bask in his glory and serve his cause. "
 overextended_and_disorganized_desc:0 "So far the ERN has accomplished… little of value. Che can call himself the God-Emperor of Communism all he wants but in reality, he commands miles upon miles of dense jungle and an army of untrained teenagers, many times believing in conflicting flavors of Communism. Consistently beaten back on expansion attempts, the excitement Che produces on his followers fades fast when confronted with reality, and those cracks will start to show very quickly if a real victory is not achieved soon."
 revengist_spirit_desc:0 "After the humiliating defeats of the 1964 Liberal Revolts that pushed the 6th Military Region over the São Francisco river, many in their ranks see returning to the Northeast as their eternal and primary objective, with intense hate against [CFD.GetName] they long for the day when they will gain their desired revenge against Arreas. General Bastos writes constantly to Brasília requesting authorization to invade the northeast once again, being repeatedly denied by Generalissimo Castelo Branco who prefers a less bloody approach, nonetheless, the hope remains high for an eventual return to the sertões and the General's troops continue to muster on their river bank. \n\n §O''Ninguém pôde opor-se às armas do 6º Exército, presentes por toda aquela vasta região do Brasil, como se seu destino grandioso as tivesse feito cair do céu.''§! - Justino Bastos"
 the_knockedout_giant_BRA_desc:0 "There is a popular expression that used to often come out in patriotic times of old, ''The Giant has Awakened''. It was usually said when families gathered around the radio to listen to a football match, hurdling together as one to cheer for Brazil, back when it too was one. \nIts meaning goes deeper than that, however. The Giant, Brazil and its people, seem to rarely show their full potential, waking up only once a few decades such as in 1945, when it honorably intervened in WW2, and in 1960, when Juscelino made it look ''unrecognizably intelligent''. \nAt any other given time the Giant lays dormant, the Brazilian people watch mutely as Generals and Politicians dictate their lives, acting as silent spectators as armies march on the streets and clash against one another in the countryside, they have always been largely indifferent to the going-ons of Brasilía, Rio, or anywhere else. \nSuch was the occasion in 1963 when the Military attempted a hastily put together coup d'éta against the Goulart presidency, leading to 5 lengthy years of civil war, marked by a distinctive lack of commitment by the people of both sides and restricted merely to infrequent military engagements. Truthfully, there were bigger things to worry, the Nuclear Winter that accompanied the civil war and the breakdown of international trade brought famine and desperation to the people, leading them to care little about a few armed fusses half a country away. \nThe lack of devotion from the population and scarcity of resources to carry out the unexpectedly long-lasting war didn't just make the Giant fall asleep, it made it so he knocked himself out!
