 CoariIntroduction.1.t:0 "How did we get here?"
 CoariIntroduction.1.d:0 "The River of Gold, the Land of Gas, River of the Gods, The Pearl of Solimões; Those are all names once given to the city of Coari, the 5th largest and one of the most isolated towns in northern Brazil, located just west of Manaus in the dense heart of the Amazon rainforest, but what makes this city shine also came to be it's own downfall, following the 1962 military coup that deposed President João Goulart and the following civil war that still rages on, Coari came to be one of the cities occupied by the Amazonian Military Command, one of the Brazilian Army's regional defence forces, in an effort to maintain peace during a time of crisis.\n \nIn 1965 however with the prolongment of the war, infighting between Junta and Loyalist forces inside the ranks of the Amazonian Military Command and the lack of men in the southern frontlines forced it to be recalled from Coari and the Amazon as a whole, stationed only in Manaus, Parintins, Nhamundá and Belém, however their mark stayed behind.\n \nBe it for lack of supervision, overdeployment, undersupplying of troops or a combination of all made so the army's treatment of the civilian population turned harsher and harsher by the day, beatings on the streets and sporadic fire were seen around the city between loyalist and Junta aligned soldiers, with civilians getting caught in the crossfire, such horrors however cannot compare to what came on March 1st 1965, 3 days before the troops retreat from the the Amazon and 1 day before the start of the Carnaval.\n \nDuring a communal dinner organized by the local church as a departure gift for the soldiers, unbeknownst to all, liquor got smuggled in, men got drunk, tensions escalated and soon blood was shed and by the end of the night the Solimões river reflected the orange light of the burning city.\n \nThe pillaging carried on for a day, few houses were spared, women were stripped from their husbands and children; The following day the soldiers departed earlier than expected, carrying with them trophies as if taken from life long enemy's homes, and the Pearl of Solimões was left behind without it's shine."

 CoariIntroduction.2.t:0 "The Pearl of Solimões."
 CoariIntroduction.2.d:0 "If you go up the Amazon river departing from Manaus there isn't much to see besides the seemingly endless torrent of dark brown water ahead of you and the lush green forest surrounding you, at least for the untrained eye that is, those who can appreciate it's beauty may notice the endless colorful tropical birds dotting the sky every sunset and sunrise in great flocks, the alien like lifestyle of the villages of interconnect stilt houses living off the rivers, and after a whole day of travel the meeting point where the dark waters of the Negro river meet with the calm, light brown Solimões at the birthplace of the Amazon.\n \nIf you decide to turn left and go up the muddy brown waters of the Solimões however you will be surprised with what you find, for in the heart of that dense isolated jungle lives a treasure of inimmaginabile value, a pearl that shines so bright it's light guides the lost like a lighthouse towards the warm welcoming embrace of a kind and hardworking people, and it's name is Coari.\n \nA wonder built by God fearing men who like the pioneers of the American Frontier dedicated their lives to settling this wild land and taming it into something worth calling home, and by God they did it, the Harbor is the gateway from which the stones that built the Colonial style Getúlio Vargas Square and the pride of the town, the Friary of Sant'Anna came from, where man from all over the world teach and guide a new generation of priests."

 CoariIntroduction.3.t:0 "The White Linned Mayor."
 CoariIntroduction.3.d:0 "Born in the dry and misery-fertile lands of the Brazilian northeast, Montoril quickly fell in love with the wet and mysterious north when he moved there at an early age, his childhood however would not be an easy or happy one becoming an orphan and having to look after his brothers working as a black and goldsmith, police officer, dentist and finally enrolling in politics during the short lived tenentist levants of '32, when he became Military Mayor of Coari following the murder of it's former mayor, that however sparked his legendary career in Coarense politics and the Golden age of the city that, under his guidance, has managed to thrive for decades and emerge with prominence from the deep, dark jungle. As an old man in '61 he was elected again as mayor after a long hiatus from politics as if destiny itself put him in charge of his beloved little town once again in a time of desperation. During Coari's sacking on March 1st 1965 his reign almost came to a bloody end if not for the civilian mob that surrounded and protected him and his office during the chaos, a showcase of the people's gratitude and love for him. To anyone outside of the now desolate city this may seems... weird, but the undeniable only reason Coari still stands, even if only half alive, is the presence and guidance of this well dressed man."
 CoariIntroduction.3.A:0 "Charming fella"
 Coari.4.t:0 "Fish and Bananas."
 Coari.4.d:0 "The door to Montoril's office was heavily guarded day and night, the guards never had to do anything but look angrily at people that came too close, but they nonetheless carried military assalt rifles scavenged from the Carnaval sacking all those years ago, still, those are hardly necessary, no one would ever dare to do any harm to the mayor, still Montoril insisted on having them watch over him day and night.\nThe door opened slightly, the face of one of the guards swooped in.\n''Sir, Father Hirsch has paid you a visit.''\n \nMontoril rose his head from the letter he spent the last hours drafting, visibly surprised by the visitor.\n''Hirsch? What is he doing here at this time of night, shouldn't he be at the dinner?''\n \n''That's... why he came sir, you haven't shown up there for more then a month now, he brought you something to eat.''\nThe lack of formalities wasn't seen as disrespect by Montoril in any way, those men cared for him like a son cares for his father, and he understood that, the guard opened the door, revealing a platter of cooked bananas and fish wrapped in a white cloth, still steaming hot, not fancy but that's all they had now.\n''Should I leave it at your table or...''\n \n''No, no'' Montoril interrupted, he sighed looking at the piles of useless drafts and unsent letters addressed to Brasília, it's weird to think that while trying to help the town he distanced himself from it's people, always locked in his office, always drafting another plan to make them last one more week afloat.\n \n''Has Hirsch left the building yet?'' He asked.\n \nThe guard looked back for a moment to check. ''I believe not sir, I can hear his voice downstairs.'' The guard replied."

 Coari.2.d:0 "''Hey, do you want to be a man? If yes, you need to hold this gun and fire.'' \n \nThat was Arthur, Montoril's mouthpiece for getting some new people to the Coari Defense Militia, brigade number 2, platoon number 1. The young man who held the rifle barely expected the weight going against his shoulder and body, breathing in carefully to save face, trying to look as manly as possible. He looked forward to the target - a small bottle, rusted and forgotten by time - and breathed out, firing the spare bullet against the bottle, the caliber slowly entering the glass and shattering it into a million pieces. The young man lost his balance due to the recoil, running back and his ear ringing from the loud crackle of the rifle's bolt. His friends looked and laughed at him, yet their turn was coming too. The second young man came, confident and ready to shoot, reloading his bolt-action rifle and aiming to the second bottle. He aimed with certainty, and shot with the same certainty, the rifle making his arm lunge backwards and make him trip on himself. The last teenager, the most confident of them all, prepared his shot and fired at the third bottle. He stood triumphantly, looking at the shattered bottle and a small bird which he had also shot by accident."
 Coari.2.A:0 "We have a long way to go, kids."
 Coari.1.t:0 "It's a long, long way to Santarém."
 Coari.1.d:0 "''How long will the journey take?'' Asked the old lady.\n \n''If we're luck just 4 days but with canoes I doubt it will be so quick, specially with all the weight.'' Answered the young man. ''Don't worry mom, I'll be fine.'\n \nHe held her wrinkled hands together in a caring gesture looking her gently in the eyes. ''I'll be back by the end of the week, don't worry, no one will risk their lives for a fancy sofa and a new pair of shoes.''\n \nHe smiled proudly of his own joke but it had no effect on the old lady, she stuttered for a moment not knowing what to say, alternating her attention between her son and the canoes and small vessels filled to the brim with furniture, chests carrying small useless trinkets and few things with actual value.\n \n''You are not coming back, are you son?''\n \n''Of course I a-''\n \n''You didn't load anything to sell in Santarém besides your clothes, you're not going there to pay the militia, you're leaving us, aren't you son?''\n \nLurdes could be old but she kept her smarts and she knew her son well, while leaving he made the effort of not taking anything valuable to her, only his personal belongings, she knew damn well what was happening.\n \n''Mother, I... This city is dead, there's no hope left here anymore just look at what we are doing! Praying to god that a bunch of payed murderers will save us from getting murdered in exchange for our fucki- damned wardrobes.'' He gripped her harder. ''Once I get to Santarém I'll take a boat to Manaus, find a job in the plantations or maybe as a soldier of fortune, I will come back for you I promise but I can't stay in Coari anymore.''\n \nTears started to sprout in both as the weight of the lie came crashing down, the old lady held her son's hand against her face one last time and reached for something in her pocket, taking out a small silver object.\n \n''You forgot your father's tie clip in the drawer, I hoped you would get married wearing it just like he did but it may be worth something.''\n She put it in his hand and closed it tight.\n \n''I didn't forget it mother...''"

 ACRIntroduction.1.t:0 "How did we get here?"
 ACRIntroduction.2.t:0 "The Republic, reborn"
 ACRIntroduction.3.t:0 "The white liquid of life."
 ACRIntroduction.1.d:0 "In the eve of the 19th century the revolutionary ideals of France and the liberal optimism of the United States made their way into the deep dark Bolivian jungle, giving birth to the first Republic of Acre, based on surprisingly modern ideals for such a backwaters place and time. \nNonetheless the light of such revolution would be quickly and repeatedly snuff out, first by the Bolivians, then Brazilians, and 3 more times the Republic would rise just to be stomped back into being a historical footnote in the history of Latin American republics, but even after it's visionary leaders are all long dead and buried and it's flags stolen and re appropriated the ideals created by this 'footnote' lives on to this day in the minds of the educated folk. \n \nIn 1962 the world would be brought to its knees and in the process tyranny would again come to Rio Branco, ironically though the same fire responsible for ending the mighty republics of France and America also rekindled the fires of revolution in the deep secluded Brazilian jungle."
 ACRIntroduction.2.d:0 "In 1962 federal troops marched on the streets of Brasília announcing the army coup, while some resisted and still resist to this day the state of Acre, elevated to a state from a Federal Territory just one year prior, was quickly overwhelmed by the local Junta Loyal garrison of the 4th Frontier Battalion who sieged Rio Branco Palace until the then governor, José Augusto de Araújo, surrendered peacefully to the federal troops passing the title of Governor to Edgar Cerqueira and being taken to Brasília to await judgement in prison. \nHowever, as conflicts against Republican forces escalated into open civil war Acre's military occupation by the Amazonian Military Command came to an abrupt end when the occupation force was recalled from the state to serve more actively in the war, leaving the rebellious state essentially independent, but also very, very vulnerable. \nAs soon as the Brazilian troops left danger came from Bolivia once again as Che Guevara's ragtag of guerrilla fighters pushed north into Brazil, being bravely (and miraculously) stopped in Brasiléia by a combined force of civilian militias and the former 4th Frontier Battalion, and in the wake of such victory Acrean nationalism was catapulted back into mainstream, Edgar's military government became more of a suggestion then rule as his forces were now outnumbered and outgunned by victorious proud militia man, and seeing themselves abandoned by the Brazilian Government and with a renewed sense of national pride Acre declared its formal independence from Brazil, taking its first step towards a becoming the America's newest Republic."
 ACRIntroduction.3.d:0 "Latex is the blood of the Republic, for millennia before the arrival of Europeans natives would turn it into balls for the children to play or use it for basic repairs and tool making, in the 19th century this industry boomed as vehicles and machines in Europe and the United States now required rubber to function, bringing much wealth to those who sold it and much suffering for those who harvest it. \nAs expected the republic's economy isn't an industrial one, far from it, instead Acre's economy is entirely dependent on the renewed rubber trade which while profitable (specially after the complete collapse of the production of synthetic rubber in Europe and the US) is also a very, very exploitative job, tappers are constantly being exposed to every danger the jungle can offer from disease to wild animals, often away from city centers where medical help can be offered if ever needed, wages are low and life conditions even worse not to mention the impact these rubber plantations have on nature and the native communities that cover much of Acre's territory. \nThese inhuman conditions are fundamentally against the original beliefs of the Republic but still we are dependent on trade with Manaus if we want to prosper and grow in power and relevance, time will tell if the ideals of old will be upheld or forgotten when faced with reality."
 ACRIntroduction.1.A:0 "A light that won't be snuffed out easily."
 ACRIntroduction.2.A:0 "The first step is usually the hardest one."
 ACRIntroduction.3.A:0 "The elastic and rubbery reality of life."
 ACR.1.d:0 "With all senators united in Rio Branco work on the Constitution has begun, while the ideals of the original Acre Republic are highly regarded amongst all, and the old laws imposed by the Brazilian Government are still used as a basis, this is a time of great change and radical unexpected reforms could end up being put in place if so desired by the senators. \n \nThe 22 senators here united come from all parts of Acre and some are even from beyond it's borders, as a result no one has any strong relationship with anyone else, mix that with the fact that Acre doesn't have a strong political history makes so there are no existing parties those senators can affiliate themselves with, instead, new parties are being created as the constitution is written and senators get to meet each other, grouping into 3 groups of like minded individuals, the Nationalists, who value the original values of the Republic and are united by a strong sense of national pride, the Militarists, mainly members of the former 4th Frontier Battalion or militia members bitter from the attack from Ce Guevara who believe the only way to save Acre's sovereignty is my turning it into a true fighting force capable of defending itself, and the Technocrats, a loose group of intellectuals, poets, artists and social activists coming from the lower levels of society, while some brand them as communist they advocate for better more humane work conditions for tappers and much needed social reforms. \n \nOnce the constitution is signed an indirect election will take place where the senators will vote for one of them to become president, the candidate of the party with most seats will be granted the honor of becoming the first President of the Acre Republic, finally ending the period of Provisional Government."
 ACR.2.d:0 "The Senate has come to the conclusion that integrating the native communities into ''civilized'' world is not something we can afford to do, at least not in the present time, such worries are mainly good hearted however with few talks of ''racial superiority'', concerns are mainly economical and of the well being of the native communities as integrating them would not only disturb their traditional way of life but also expose them to disease and exploitation from land lords, they are best left alone, the question is, how alone?"
 ACR.3.d:0 "Talks of equality have won the Senate, while some argue that complete integration of the natives could cause a disturbance of their traditional way of life and exposition to unnecessary evils, it was ultimately decided that all men are equal inside the Republic independent of color, language or birthplace, however even inside the Senate racism against native Americans is very much present, the question now is if those ideals of equality should be forced and indoctrinated into the population's mindset or only enforced by law."
 ACR.4.d:0 "Words are dangerous, Brazil's failure in stopping the spread of ideas was what created the Acre Republic in the first place and in an ironic twist we must not commit the same mistake as them, the state needs a strong hand over the few media outlets it has at its disposal, the question is how hard should we grip them?"
 ACR.5.d:0 "Our nation was founded in the mold of liberal democracy, the same as the once mighty United States of America, and as such we cannot allow ourselves to do such tirany as to supress the people's right to speak and protest, even if against us from time to time, as such Freedom of Speech shall be a guaranteed right inside our borders, the question now is, how ''free'' should this freedom be?"
 ACR.6.d:0 "The elefant in the room, worker's rights, heated debate between Technocrats and the rest eventually culminated into a victory for the plantation elites and, to a degree, downright sociopaths, going against the 1888 Áurea law that abolished slavery in Brazil a minority favors radical reforms that would allow landowners to essentially own workers as servants for minimal wages, a new form of serfdom akin to what can be seen in Manaus's unregulated rubber plantations, few favor such radical reforms that distance themselves so much from our libertarian ideals, but maybe some men shouldn't be so free as others if that's for the betterment of the state, the question now is, how far should we go?"
 ACR.7.d:0 "The elefant in the room, worker's rights, heated debate between Technocrats and the rest eventually culminated into a victory for the social justice warriors, a not insignificant step towards betterment of the people's lifes, the question now is, how hard should we push those reforms?"
 ACR.8.d:0 "The days following the withdrawal of federal troops from Acre were days of chaos and desperation, Edgar's authority broke down as the people organized into militias for and against Ce Guevara's iminent invasion, fighting between syndicalist tapper militias led by Wilson de Souza and the former 4th Frontier Battalion broke out in the streets of Xapuri, and once the main attacking force from the red army came intense resistance was made on Brasiléia and Rio Branco, ultimately repelling Ce's forces and saving Acre from a fate akin to Rondônia's in a glorious although costly victory, Wilson was banished from Acre, the Republic was consolidated and Ce Guevara went back to Bolivia to lick his wounds, a tense peace now exists, another attack in the near future seems eminent and Ce's forces grow stronger by the day, we all wait and pray that when the day comes we are able to best them back once again."
 ACR.9.d:0 "Acting as independent defense forces, many militias still roam the country side vowing to protect citizens from the red Menace to the south, still such unregulated fighting force is prone to making ''unfortunate accidents'' like shooting civilians ''accidentally'', occasionally looting entire villages or declaring innocent people enemies of the state and communist sympathizers, they have to be organized into a disciplined fighting force and fast before things spiral out of control, and the first step in doing so is regulating recruitment."

 ACR.18.d:0 "The Amazon is unforgiving to flimsy intellectuals. The unstoppable and merciless Hell of green that surrounds the tiny outposts of civilisation proves that little can be done for real advanced technological, social, and industrial progress. At least, that was the reality for the last couple hundred years. Due to the relatively unscathed position Acre passed through the Apocalypse with relative to other places, it has been remarkably easy finding materials and needed resources to create Acre's first university.\nAt the edge frontier of the Lusophone amazon, birthed out of exploring rubber tappers and a country of free people, Acre has never allowed itself the same fate of other smaller outposts in the Amazon like Benjamin Constant or Fonte Boa, which have to cope with an increasingly overbearing Indigenous authority which blocks much of the commerce in the area - after all, Manaus would never trade with an Indian.\n Reflections aside, it seems that Acre's attempt at beginning to build a new center of education for all the curious minds and those of brainy strength - as opposed to muscle strength - to develop themselves. Everything from music to history books to magazines to campus grounds allows for an increasing urban culture in Rio Branco, where young adults can finally begin living a more modern life in a place where being able to do so requires defiance of every motion of nature."

His past in the Shindo Remnei meant he was an invaluable asset to figuring out how to make a militia function. Regardless, his subordinates here seemed to be more interest in making jokes about women than figuring out how to have military discipline.\n\n''Alright guys, I need you to sit up and look at me. NOW!''\n\nThe sudden scream had scared everyone straight, and some couldn't help but immediately try to apologise - ''Sir, sorry sir!'' and all that. Yet it did not convince Taguchi. He wanted proof these men were ready to fight for their homeland, their town, their city.\n\n''If you all feel so convinced about yourselves, why don't you look out from this base - and see what's out and beyond?''\n\nThe commander demanded the attention of the entire corps, and made them leave their barracks in Brasiléia to trek out at the - former - Bolivian border, which is now extremely porous and filled to the brim with ERN soldiers.\n\n''Are you all really ready to face that kind of assault? I fought communism in Brazil in my youth - I won't let any of you get soft at those guys either.''\n\nThe corps seemed less cocky now. Some of the soldiers had already been completely loyal, and only a few elements really were questioning Taguchi's leadership.\n\nOne soldier protested - ''Why the hell are we at such a risky position? They could attack us anytime.''\n\nTaguchi flicked his fingers and snapped them, smiling gently.\n''Exactly, soldier. We need to always be alert - if they ever touch even a centimeter of Acrean territory - that's when we know we'll have to do our duty. You're all paid for a reason - you've all come here to rise above your social rank and fight for something in common. Regardless of where you're from - we must defend our homeland from those seeking to destroy it under the auspices of evil governments. My homeland is no longer Japan - it is long gone now. But that, regardless of where we're originally from - is not what defines us. As Acreans, we are defined as a people that love our national liberty. We will not allow anyone to tread that!''\n\nThe corps was now ecstatic, with great faith in their future as defenders of Acre."

The Green Room, practically a treehouse, was filled with children that couldn't share toys.

 ACR.13.d:0 "The Senate has been called in to discuss the power and authority of the police over the citizens of our glorious republic. The Militarists propose increased police power, even to a somewhat insane degree, calling for a ''safe and secure society'', granting police almost limitless power and military grade funding, with the police being reorganized under the military system, thus having the militias under the command of generals, and not police chiefs, turning them into a municipal defense and peacekeeping force. The Technocrats prefer a lighter approach, by hiring foreign specialists from the former Brazilian Republic (And most controversially, ex soldiers defecting from Che Guevara's Army) and heavy police training, but while also keeping police corruption to a minimum by disbanding the militias and keeping stricter police regulations. The debate has been the topic of much interest in the country, or police reform could be just around the corner..."

 ACR_cury.1.d:0 "With the drafting and signing of the new Acrean Constitution of 1967, nearly two dozen of the Senate's previously empty seats have been filled as each choice and amendment passed empowered its proposing faction. With a now full Senate and a Constitution enacted, a vote within the chamber has been held to elect the nation's President for the next 4 years.\n\nThe victor is Hélio Cury, a member of the Nationalist Party. Despite how the word nationalist might conjure up thoughts of ethnic supremacists and racists, imperialists and conquerors, and warmongers and militarists, Cury is far from being dribed by any of those terms. Cury's nationalism is the belief in the independence of Acre as a free and democratic state, and the preservation of that independence, as opposed to those who would argue for integration with Brazil, for example.\n\nCury, holding a strong presence in the Senate, has promised economic reforms and an overhaul of the Republic's infrastructure, making him popular amongst the average Acrean across socioeconomic lines, and holds an especially high level of support amongst the indigenous people, whose rights he has argued for consistently. In terms of foreign policy, Cury is supportive of a more diplomatic and peaceful approach to neighboring statelets, especially in relation to the natives."

Despite the economical importance of this industry, to an extent that any acrean could say that inside his blood vessels flown a mix of red blood and white latex, still operates in a primitive fashion, notably in the absence of any kind of labor rights legislation of the tappers, the abysmal social rift between the seringalistas and the tappers, whom worked to the seringlistas, and the permanent tying of the latter with the seringals where they worked by a system of permanent debt. The seringals are mostly private-owned unregulated rubber production plants composed by the central building called Barracão (The Shed), where everything that the tappers cannot produce by themselves is put on sale and all the rubber they produced is sold; Colocações (Locations), an area assigned for the tappers to build improvised shacks (Tapiris) to live with their families while working in the seringal; Estradas de Seringa (Rubber trees spot), obviously the place of the precious and toxic latex; for last but not least important O Defumador (The Smoker), whose function is to fume the látex until it turnes into pélas de borracha (thick rubber balls). Hélio has, as one of his first presidential acts, plans to draft the first regulation code of the rubber tapping industry ever made in order to ensure that better working conditions are achieved but foremost, besides drafting the code, is that he'll need to find common ground with some factions of the Acrean National Congress and compromise with them to pass his legislation."

They also want the inclusion of a kind of welfare net to alleviate the most poverty-stricken parts of the Acrean population, a more aggressive regulation and supervision of the working conditions inside the Seringais, base of the majority of our rubber production.

They want the hardening of both the stance and the approach towards the tapper rallies as the top brass of our military staff emphatically points those rallies as potential hotbeds for the spreading of more radical ideas done directly or indirectly by Guevarist agents and sympathisers infiltrated inside our nation and these same agitators could act as a fifth column inside Acre or even try to topple the government if they gather the support of enough disgruntled acreans. Other demands put forth by the militarist clique are a huge raise in the budget designated to the Armed Forces and the enactment of Total Mobilization, gearing all of our resources to war preparations.

However, this happening wasn't limited only to that seringal, as the tappers of some seringais near by also went on strike in a quite coordinated manner, with the seringueiros (tappers) seizing the properties entirely.

What seemed to be a swift and easy path through which Cury's ambitious reformist ideas, brand new to a backward state such as Acre and yet to be evaluated outside of the planning sheets, could be transformed not only into official legislation but as effective government actions. However, the political atmosphere changed dramatically since the so-called Dias Branco Strike, whose outcome angered Militarists and Technocrats alike as their proposals were turned down by Cury himself after heated arguments, in which the government decided to surround striking seringais, starving them out into submission.  Cury's strategy worked, as he neither damaged his popular support by not brutally suppressing nor showed weakness conceding to strikers' demands. This ''independent'' move caused a special unpleasant consequence, namely the rising of a small organized opposition movement inside the ANC, currently unable to cripple any of his ongoing reform proposals due to its small size but can be a thorn in our side if left unchecked.  Cury, the embodiment of Nacionalista Party core ideas and beliefs aside from his own, hoped to not resort to any old political vices that tainted many politicians before him. The times, however, they are a-changin’, different times require less idealistic and more pragmatic methods, especially in the wild political arena.

However, there are rumors, from some sources inside the FUNAI itself, that the agency, known unofficially in some intellectual circles as Fundação Nacional de Inteligência (Foundation of National Intelligence) in a clear mockery to the official name, has a covert purpose: coopt members of these populations as special agents and military aides, making use of their vast knowledge in some fields labeled as vital to our military such as their knowing of Acrean geography (land, fluvial and terrain), jungle tracking and reconnaissance, survival within the jungle environment and jungle warfare (including guerrilla tactics), in which natives excel.

These however, weren't normal pirates, her captain acknowledged that very quickly, their semi-armoured tugs  bearing the colors and flag of Coari,  ''Everything carefully planned to catch us by surprise, not fruit of a random desire to amass wealth by some low-ranking officer but part of a masterminded plan to harass our shipping lines'' thought the captain. He had no other choice than surrendering the ship after a brief and hopeless fight, being allowed however, together a few of the surviving crewmen, to board a lifeboat with enough supplies to let them reach Manaus and relay the disastrous news to Rio Branco."

 ACR_cury.24.d:0 "By: José Guiomard dos Santos, commander of the Red Frontier Battalion.\n\nBriefing: After collecting and examining reports from extra official incursions, frontier patrols, and expatriates coming from the former territory of Rondônia, now under the control of the ERN, I’ve come to the conclusion that Che’s hold on the north of the territory, specifically the area encompassing Porto Velho, is exceptionally weak when compared to his Bolivian holdings. In short, Che controls Rondônia only nominally, keeping his grasp on the territory by intimidation of the residual populace and the promise of reprisal in case of rebellion. Nevertheless, we cannot disregard the possibility of greater military presence in the south, where clashes between Che and the Brazilian Military Junta have been reported.\nOne particular incursion into Rondônia reported that large stretches of the Madeira-Mamoré railroad remain active on a small scale, operated and maintained by the civilian populace for everyday needs, by taking it the team reached as far as Porto Velho before retreating, encountering no opposition. The ERN appears to be unaware or indifferent to the railroad’s existence or operational status.\nD.P.24 proposes a covert operation to connect Acre’s existing railroad network to the Madeirá-Mamoré, providing direct access to Porto Velho and Guajará Mirim, depending on the success of the operation the network could be expanded as far as Riberalta. Although risky this could provide us direct access to the behind enemy lines causing major disruption of their frontline during an invasion attempt of Acre, as well as excellent support for our infantry if we were to ever set foot in Rondônia. \n\nDetails on estimated cost provided in the annex."

As the days went on, eventually the flag of the Quatro Povos das Missões could be found, flying high in the port town of Camundé, brought about a wave of cheerfulness across the emaciated crewsmen. With that, several priests which they'd catch from the surrounding outposts, being recalled from their missions, continued to communicate with the QPM to gain their favor, and maybe get the promised medicine. After hours of conversation, it appears that along with several medically skilled priests, medication would finally be given.\n\nOnce the boxes came to the boats, the excited crewsmen went happily back to Acre. Yet, something still rung in their bellies that this might not be military-grade medication. Nonetheless, they continued on, reaching several outposts such as Fonte Boa. They would reach home in due time, surely. When it was the time to open the crates, several men took crowbars and begun to take out the medication; some syringes, sterile. Some less so.

Decades later, these men were mistreated and ignored by their communities, forgotten to the corners of historical footnotes. And yet, from the deepest edges of Brazil's land came Hélio Cury, one of the major figures of the Acrean nationalist movement, who firmly believes in giving what every injusticed bastard child of the Amazon was not given to them by the Federal Government, to be given justice as soon as possible.

It appears that Cury has succeeded in his entirety to fulfill his ideals, having created a deeply entrenched democracy and a proud society, which grows wealthier by the day.

Marques' theatricality may be a powerful tool on the unwashed masses but it did little to hide from the gentlemen the fact that, in reality, he knew little of the intricate network of trade that Acre depended on. \nIn the end, no deal would be reached today, for now at least.

Time and time again we have distanced ourselves and made it harder to trade with Manaus. The PNA would like to remind the Senate that the Republic of Acre is only alone if we choose to isolate ourselves, and the facilitation of trade with Manaus will give Acre the resources we need to keep ourselves not only sustained but strong.''\n\n''You force us to decide between terrorists and criminals? How rich!'' yells out another militarist senator. \n\n''Enough!'' Marques cries out, ''I agree with everyone here as do the members of the PdP.'' He looks at his party’s seats as they look at each other confused, some nodding in agreement. \n''I will personally see it that the PdP works closely with the military in enacting the Mordaça Act to safeguard our interior and loosen the restrictions on tapping. \n\nThis is reasonable to the PNA and the army.'' Marques leans on the podium, looking to the PdP members, ''Right?''\n\nSome of the PdP senators nod in compliant agreement, while one gets up in a heated movement, ''Unbelievable!'' he utters as he heads out the door. \n\nAfter Marques’ display, the silence in the room begins to dissipate and more mundane topics are discussed for the remainder of the proceedings. \n\nThe PdP senator, João Branco, who left in a huff-and-puff reconvened with the President in his office later that day, begging him for an answer why the PdP’s supports codifying the Mordaça Act."

President Marques and Guevara discussed what had previously been discussed in the letters, but now in greater detail, laying out the plans for Acre and the ERN’s future. \n\n''Now remember Marques, I am not someone who doesn’t find things out.

ACR_cerqueira.1.d:0 "With the drafting and signing of the new Acrean Constitution of 1967, nearly two dozen of the Senate's previously empty seats have been filled as each choice and amendment passed empowered its proposing faction. With a now full Senate and a Constitution enacted, a vote within the chamber has been held to elect the nation's President for the next 4 years.\n\nThe victor is Edgar Cerqueira, one of the nation's most prominent militarists and a former army commander. Extremely critical of communism and the Technocratic faction, who Cerqueria has decried as socialist sympathizers, the strongman has called for major military buildup and the formation of a professional Acrean army to fend off raids and destroy the ERN. Cerqueira is also seemingly more friendly to the Brazilian Military Junta than the other two candidates of the election, leading to fears amongst opposition members that he will sell out the Republic to Brasilia - claims that the new President has fiercely denied."

This reckless behavior is unexceptable. We are trying to rebuild the world for you to do this.

Nhem nhem nhem, the hell people! You have one fucking job and you failed dammit! And what's worse, is that Branco really doesn’t fucking care about us.

honduran_flavors.1.d:0 "Mrs. Carmen Juárez was already an elderly woman of white hair and skin, with freckles in her hands and face. Her eyes a deep blue, still owner of a mischievous childlike look. In San Marcos de Colon she was widely known as Pacana, as she had served as a field nurse in the war of 1924 under then president dr. Rafael López Gutierrez, who people nicknamed Pacán. In her wanderings with doctor López she acquired some medical knowledge, as when peace came to Honduras once more she dedicated to the profession of midwife, in times when medics were scarce, especially in towns like San Marcos de Colon. \n\nWhen a woman was ''interesting'', as they used to call pregnant women back then, la Pacana took care of advising her and preparing her for the birthing. According to the shape of the stomach she would predict the sex of the baby. Her predictions would always prove accurate, exclaiming ''Didn’t I tell you I was right?!'' when the baby was finally brought into the world. The children of the neighborhood would realize many things, and get disillusioned with many others, like the tale of the stork bringing the newborns, as the laments of the parturient women would be heard throughout the night. \n\nHer procedure was simple and humble. She’d only ask for hot water and soap to wash her hands, sheets, clean towels and a container of quarter of a liter of moonshine, which she’d use to prepare the mix that would calm the nerves of the forthcoming mothers. She conserved serenity and stood calm, as her nerves had been tempered in the heat of the battles and her senses accustomed to the dry sneeze of rifles, the smell of the gunpowder and the cries of the wounded. She’d spend the night at the side of the nervous mother, and from then on she’d visit her daily for the next 40 days, advising her on motherhood and watching over her. If the mother was too poor to pay for her services, she’d be satisfied with whatever amounts they could muster and the girl’s gratitude. \n\n As she had helped birth most of us children in the neighborhood, she treated us like her sons. Scolding us when we behaved incorrectly or when we feigned sickness to avoid going to school. Each second Sunday of the month of May, while we celebrate Mother’s Day, go to la Pacana, our midwife. Lay the flowers of memory, as long ago now she sleeps the dream of the just, in a forgotten and humble tomb in the pantheon of our beloved town."

CFD_intro.1.d:0 "The northeast is already very used to decadence and negligence through the tough days after the end of the golden age of the sugar-cane economy still in the portuguese colonization days, but the end of the world absolutely ravaged every remaining hope of a improvement of the stagnation and crippled the profitis of the coronéis, even if the region itself was safe from radiation and nuclear hellfire. This made many different movements gain never before seen support from the desperate populace, and scared that this might lead to the end of their uncontested rule in the region the coronéis supported the military coup and the deportation of Miguel Arraes to the coastal island of Fernando de Noronha. The army had, however, more pressing matters than the many issues of the northeast, and the 6th military region did not have the resources to manage the situation at all, meaning they were effectively running on borrowed time."

CFD_intro.2.t:0 "Our Turbulent Renaissance"
CFD_intro.2.d:0 "With support dropping ever more and with an increasingly desperate situation to practically everyone, the command of the 6th military region could only watch as even the most pettiest of revolts became unmanageable to their frail order. The most fanatical of resistances against the junta came from the peasants leagues, led by the infamous PCB member Gregório Bezerra. The more moderate but still progressive resistance came from the praieiros, which constitute mostly urban groups which are in favour of many reforms to the nation in order to renovate the social and political fabric of the region, some even being pro-republic and wanting to uproot the military coup that tried to take away the power from its legal owner, João Goulart. Ironically though, most of the usineiros and coronéis were in favour of the expulsion of the military, mainly because their absolute negligence of the economic devastation of the region and refusal to support their centuries old political hegemony of the region, which quickly began to wane after the collapse of the sugar trade. To put the final nail to the coffin for the 6th Military Region, the sudden comeback of Miguel Arraes from Fernando de Noronha with the help of some firefighters stationed on the island and practically unanimous support from the military police further solidified the Junta’s failure to hold the northeast and gave the birth to the unified northeastern state, created through clever political maneuvers from Arraes."

CFD_intro.3.t:0 "Our blurry bright future"
CFD_intro.3.d:0 "With the military fully expelled from the region, Arraes had to work quickly to stabilize the region and prevent further economic collapse, and so he did. With partial agrarian reform and government help to the usineiros to diversify their crops, the famine that had started since the collapse of the sugar trade in 1962 had been contained, and the economy started to prosper, even if in very small ways. Politically, the coronéis were not particularly happy about the agrarian reform, even if it was only partially, but they were wise enough to recognize that they might would have lost their entire power if it was not for that, mostly because Arraes made sure to convince them of that before he did it. The praieiros consider Arraes as a hero, for helping the ''Revolution of the northeast'' as they call it, and for containing the famine that ravaged the region during the ''days of lead'', as they also call it as. The peasants are mostly sympathetic to Arraes, since he provided them with much needed land to cultivate and granted extensive help to deal with the famine and economic collapse, but the limited agrarian reform did not please them entirely, with many of them still demanding greater social reform to end the inequalities that plague the region since the times of colonization. The PCB itself, although supportive of Arraes during his run for governor of Pernambuco has become more weary of him, and with their newfound power in the region gained during the time of the famine means that they can be a truly gamechanger to the success or failure of the confederacy. All in all, although the basics have been done and the immediate stability of the newborn nation has been achieved, the future is nothing if not uncertain, but optimistic."

CFD_events.1.d:0 "It was a typical day in Ceará, when citizens of the small village of barroquinha noticed a group of armed men coming from the dangerous frontier with Piauí marched into the town. Scared, they contacted the local authorities, thinking it was a raid from some cangaço group. However, when the authorities did get there, not only they had set up camp in the village, but also engaged in some friendly interactions with the villagers that didn’t run away. This occurrence quickly spread among local villages, and today we are bringing an exclusive interview with their leader, Petrônio Portella! \n\n-''How and why exactly did you come to the confederation?'' \n\n-''Both are pretty simple. We came walking, scavenging what we could from the land and gunning down anyone that got in the way. The reason we came here is simply because heard of the little revolt you guys made here, so i decided to leave that hell of a state with my boys and come here.'' \n\n''-What is your opinion on the confederation?'' the interviewer asked. \n\n''-Well, I don't really like the Junta to begin with. Talking about them, in my personal opinion, kicking them out of here was the best thing you guys could’ve done! Arraes got some guts to just outright refuse when the military told him to leave. That’s not even an opinion, that’s a fact, and against facts, there are no arguments.'' \n\n-''What are your plans for the future, if at all?'' \n\n-''Well, I'd join the confederacy right now if I could, but I have to wait for the higher-ups in the army to allow me to join officially. Don’t think it’s going to take a long time, though, considering the situation you guys are in. After that… Well, all i can think now is getting back home one day...''"

I just forgot to bring my white flag with me, that’s all. \n\n-Arraes laughs for a bit. \n\n-Well now you shouldn’t use the white flag, you should use the Sertaneja one! \n\n-Oh, that's right, i almost forgot why i came here for! \n\n-Arraes stops laughing for a moment. \n\n-You want to join the Confederacy, right? \n\n-I mean...

No, i need actual support from an army, most importantly, i need the weapons from an army. \n\n-Then, i suppose you came here with a proposal, right? You didn’t expect me to just give guns to you so you can go back to your home and… i don’t know, take a nap? \n\n-Well, the reason i need an army is because i can’t hold what i take, but you guys can. So, everywhere i kill some bastards and gain some ground, you gus get to keep that ground. You know where i going with this, right? \n\n-I guess? \n\n-Oh, don’t give me a ''i guess'', do you want cangaceiros on your border or not? \n\n-Well, i don’t. \n\n-So give me guns and hold the land, so you get land, lose the cangaceiros in you border and i get to go back home! \n\n-Ok, ok, calm down! Listen, you don’t like the Junta, right? \n\n-If i did i wouldn’t be here! \n\n-Well, that’s what i thought. Alright Portella, you’re in.

Bezerra's smile faded quickly after, the message went... \n\n''-Arraes is a reactionary wrapped with a red shirt, and everyone that defends this so-called ''moderate socialism'' is too!

CFD_events.8.d:0 "Sergipe, like all the other states that are a part of the confederacy, revolted against the junta with a coalition of militias from many different ideologies and consolidated its efforts with the comeback of Miguel Arraes. However, unlike the other states, they have taken advantage of the confederacy's unstable formation and declared its own independence when Sexias Dória came back from exile, just like arraes did himself. Since then, we had a vote to decide if their independence was legitimate, and even though every state voted ''no'', Dória’s corrupt leadership ignored this and continued with his illegal government just like the Junta did."

CFD_events.9.d:0 "As the sertaneja army mercilessly rolls through Aracaju and the last remnants of the resistance of the splinter state fades away, a mercenary which was formerly in Sergipe’s payroll sees a little boat going south. He doesn't mind it initially, but just a few minutes later when his unit was about to get into action he is informed that Dória has been evacuated and is on his way to São Paulo, but since they already have been paid they must stay and fight. Suddenly, an idea sparked into the mercenary’s head, “what if i told the guys over there on the other side of the frontline that he escaped?” This started to ring nonstop in his mind, and when he finally got assigned a duty by his captain, he could only think that maybe, by snitching that to the Sertaneja’s army officers, he could be pardoned and be allowed to live in the confederacy. Although he still was conflicted if it is a good idea to betray his comrades in the mercenary unit, he knew without a shadow of doubt that he doesn't care about Sergipe’s fate, and definitely doesn't wish to die in a frontline of a state that he’s not even from. Ultimately, he chose to:"

He and his ''Lawbringers'' that were not killed in action were all sentenced to either life in prison or the death penalty, and in Dória case, he did not get a harsher penalty than death because there isn’t one."

You left the people in the best time we had to strike and commanded the troops that killed our comrades! You are no better than- \n\nBezerra pulled his pistol from his hip and shot Prestes in the forehead, with his now lifeless body hitting the floor as a flacid package.

The battle went on for only a few hours, as the armies of the confederacy completely overwhelmed the enemy, and destroyed the lone garrison without any mercy. Some surrendered, but the marines that landed in the island had no intent on letting them live, as pretty much every living soul of the confederacy hated the garrison for its continuous terror campaing since the defeat of the 6th Region. Those who tried to escape by sea were also killed, as 3rd Naval District had encircled the island to prevent any ship from escaping.

CFD_events.19.d:0 "Our newest army report has come in. Funny thing is, it's kind of impressive that a report was possible to be done, because right now what we call ‘‘our army’’ is just a bunch of militias of... Questionable loyalty to our cause. This is the case due to the very turbulent formation of our nation, the famine that ravaged our people made it impossible for our leaders to start thinking about forming an army for ourselves, and the relative peace after the revolt against the 6th region only reinforced the complacency with the absolute chaos that is our army. However, this was not without issues. Sergipe, one of the states that fought on our side against the junta has declared independence from the confederacy, and to be honest we did not care at all at the moment as our situation did not allow for us to make any kind of invasion or stamp down on revolts. However, now that the worst times of our nation are done, we must collect ourselves and start correcting the many rough edges of our nation. To start off, we need to completely reform the army, as what we actually have at the moment are disparate militias that pledged support for our cause, but that more often than not are deeply different in terms of the ideology of each other, meaning that infighting is common and sometimes creates dangerous situations to arise. Also, we need an actual command structure, since the militias are pretty much independent from one another and only obey an overarching order given by our leadership, meaning that all we do is tell a group to ‘‘do x’’ and they do it without any supervision. At the moment, there is no debate about if there should be immediate reform, as no one would be insane enough to say that there shouldn’t, but there is one about how it should be done, as half of our officers think that we should emulate the old armies structures of Europe and the United States, having a centralized command structure and formal training, but the other half propose a reorganization of the current militia structure by creating new ‘‘quality control’’ organizations and reducing the internal infighting, but still allowing the autonomy of each unit to existing to a certain extent."

I don’t think that's what we should be discussing, though. - Maximiano responds, with a worried look on his face. \n\nWhat do you mean? - Miguel asks. \n\nIt’s about Cid, Miguel. I worry that now that he left his position as Prime Minister those troublemakers of PCB and the Usineiros will demand that you give one of their puppets that role. This may be a big headache for us, Miguel. \n\nOh, that? Don’t worry about it! The people love me, I can afford to make a few enemies. \n\nStill, it’s worrying. The PCB has the loyalty of the peasant leagues, and the Usineiros have power and influence. If we don’t act carefully, one of them will surely try to depose us, and right now we do not have that many allies when we forget the people themselves. \n\nWell, we have been compromising well until now. I don’t see how- \n\nArraes, come on. - Maximiano starts to speak harsher toward Miguel. - We have been negotiating with the aristocracy and communists simultaneously.

Underneath it, slumbered over the bar table, laid the Ex-President of Brazil. \n\n''-How did it go so wrong?'' \nHe questioned himself as he dragged a glass of cachaça across the table, face still slammed against it, stopping an inch from his open mouth and the pool of saliva, snot and tears that formed beneath it, draining down from his unkempt moustache. He didn't have the will to rise and sip the damn thing. \n\n''-Why do I keep drinking this?'' He asked himself in a somber voice. \n''-Cause it's a liquid.'' He answered in his mind. \n''-If it were solid I'd eat it.'' The thought completed itself as if said by someone else, he allowed a chuckle through the tears, even if it sounded more like a dry cough. \n\nIt was, in fact, said by someone else. A better man, younger even if not by much, a bolder man who liked to gamble and didn’t know the cost of losing, a more hopeful man... \n\n''-Hope, that's it.''

It sang! \n\nThe notes played in his mind as a cyclopic crescendo, a whirlwind of ethereal melody pulling him out of his chair towards a divine destiny! \n\n''...Jânio Quadros is the Hope! Of this Abandoned Folk!'' \n\nHe understood it now! He was once the hope of Brazil! He was once Brazil's President! His road wasn't over yet, he would win his second term! He would take back the reins of the Republic! He would sit again on the throne of Brasília and take it back from the Couping Gorillas of the Junta! He is the Hope that Brazil needs!

I AM THE GOVERNOR OF THIS GOD FORSAKEN STATE LAST TIME I CHECKE-''. \n\nBefore finishing the sentence Governor Adhemar noticed his secretary, Rosa, standing by the door, pale as snow, carrying another phone in her hands along with a notebook. Their stares crossed in silence for a moment, both with embarrassed gazes and gaping mouths. \n\n''-Natel, I'll get back to you in a moment.'' He put the phone down. \n''-Yes dear, what is it?'' The Governor asked recomposing himself. \n\n''-Sor- Sorry for interrupting you sir but there are other calls waiting, Dedini is on line 4, Mayor Farias has been trying to talk to you since yesterday and Delfim Netto has an appointment scheduled in 20 minutes, they all want to know about Mar- About last week's incident with the terrorist.'' \n\nAnother drop of sweat formed on Adhemar's wrinkly forehead, he whipped it nervously, saying. ''-Tell them what the same we told the press, the ones responsible are being searched for as we speak and Chief Deputy Nogueira is being replaced by the guy Natel indicated, the Junta deserter, what's his name.'' \n\n''-Mister João Figueiredo, sir.'' The secretary completed. ''-Yes, yes, that guy.'' \n\nMore telephones rang across the 'Palace of the Champs Elysees', the Governor's residence, Adhemar's secretary turned to the noise that echoed in the corridors, clearly as stressed if not more about the situation. \n\n''-Go see who it is now, and if it's Quadros again tell him to shove whatever proposal he has up his ass, I ain't got time for that drunk.'' \nAs the door closed behind her the Governor took a moment to breathe, this was not the type of trouble he was looking for.

It is no more than a line on an old map that symbolically marks where one revolution ends and another begins, where the commitment of the 2nd Constitutionalist Revolution to defend São Paulo out of principle comes to a deadlock and the verminous commie scum of the ''C.O.L.I.N.A.'' commences, its guerrilheiros hiding behind every ridge of the mountain range. \n\nLeading the charge, mounted on a glorious white mule was recently promoted 2nd Lieutenant Alberto Mendes, chief of the 5º Police Battalion, well, what was left of it. \nWhen Mendes was assigned to his new post he found its ranks to be seriously understaffed, most of the town's police force had either laid down their badges once the Revolution began, were drafted to fight in the civil war, or worse, mysteriously disappeared in the hills during late-night patrols much like the one he now led. \nBut Mendes had something his predecessor lacked, experience, the type only police work in the busy metropolis can give you, and he had a plan. \n\nCome dawn the police waited in position, Officer Mendes and his partner, Officer Rafael Arens, stood on a lone dirt road that lead north into Minas Gerais hours away from civilization, with their horses blocking the way behind them. Up on a nearby hill, another officer signaled the encroaching car they had been tracking for the last month or so, a rusted-out ''kombi'' van with no hope of a license plate. \nThe barely working wreck stopped meters short of the officers who crossed nervous stares with the driver and passenger inside, calmly, they began the standard procedure of walking around it to check for problems while Mendes probed the motorist."

There would be women and jolly times but most of all there would be a time of pure relaxation. \nFor a while many barked at him like hounds to do something of use, but for now, they will stop, they don’t know what it's like to lead, they never will but how could they? They were but ants compared to his magnificence, their brains not hardened and wisened like his. As Adhemar began to come back to reality, as the next set of honey-dipped words began to make their way out of his mouth, a loud shot rang throughout the city square. \n\It was over, all was real again, Adhemar looked to himself as his guards swarmed around him, he was unharmed. \nAs he was rushed off stage he wondered to himself if this was truly the ALN or another power, could the Republic be back? Was this the beginning of a Junta intervention in the state? The ALN never missed their mark, they would have never done something like this, and yet who else could oppose him? The only certainty was that the banked he so expected had just been ruined by someone with horrible aim.\n\nIn a small cottage in Santos, a furious Rosa paced back and forth. Her plan was flawless, and yet Adhemar was still alive, Toledo fucked it up. \nNot only did this attempt fail but now it was only a matter of time before Marighella becomes wise to her treachery, she would have to redraw her plans, and rearrange her positions, time was running out. \nSoon the Republic and Junta will regain their courage and aim for the City of Drizzle, lured in by the magnificence that the bumbling baffon Adhemar just announced.

They had all been duped and scammed. \n\nFor five minutes a shared mix of light-heartedness and confusion descended upon the battlefield, soldiers rested and lit cigars until a command to retreat was given and the ALN soldiers began to grab their gear and sprint off. \nPolice immediately gave chase and for a time it seemed like a wild goose chase with both sides throwing what remained of their now useless firearms at one another trying to gain the upper hand.

SAO_MARIGHELLA.1.t:0 "The Great Escape"
SAO_MARIGHELLA.1.d:0 "It was a calm night in São Paulo, perhaps the calmest it had seen since the Apocalypse. People walked merrily through the concrete labyrinth, they gathered in the bars, in the squares, in the coffee houses and cinemas without a care in the world. All because the Devil had been trapped in a bottle, and the good people of São Paulo cheered for it. \n\nBut not all cheered, some schemed. \nIn Higienópolis, Carlos Marighella sat alone in a cell, quietly writing while awaiting trial. \nHis case was a peculiar one, he was a self-admitted terrorist, a communist, a guerrilla fighter, still, none of those actions had been committed against the Constitutionalist Revolution. The ''Jundiaí-São Paulo'' train robbery, the assassination of the businessman Henning Boilesen... All done under the blissful eye of the 4th Republic against a common foe, the Military Junta based in Brasília. \n''The enemy of my enemy is my ally'' goes the saying, could the same be achieved with the Constitutionalists? \n\nThe answer came with a bang, a crack, and a pop.\n\nA bang in the street outside sends the merrymakers running for their lives, the police scrambles to take note of the situation. \n\n''Terrorism requires urban guerrillas to have a theoretical and practical knowledge of how to make explosives.'' Distraction. \n\nA crack on the deputy's door lock leaves his files up for the taking, Rosa, his secretary, grabs them before sounding the fire alarm. \n\n''It is essential to point out the importance of fires and the construction of incendiary bombs like petrol bombs in the technique of revolutionary terrorism.'' Diversion. \n\nFinally, evacuation of the precinct starts, Marighella is ripped from his cell and escorted to a police car by two officers. The secretary signals their carriage before it leaves, papers in hand, the driver stops for a brief second before... \nPop goes his head, shot dead by ''Toledo'', the officer in the passenger seat. \nHis body is thrown out of the car and the secretary takes his place, speeding off into the night. \n\n''It is an action that the urban guerrilla must carry out with great calm, decision and cold blood.'' Division. \n\nThe plan was a success, despite its boldness. Marighella, the boss, acted as the perfect eye bait, drawing all attention to him and leaving none to the list of Junta associates amidst the documents that Rosa stole. \n\nMarighella was now Enemy of the State Number One, there was only one thing left to do, with him, and those on the list..."

SAO_MARIGHELLA.2.d:0 "''-Are you seeing this shit?'' Toledo yelled as he slammed the latest supply manifest onto the small wooden table in front of him. \n\n''-How can I run my operations when our own damn suppliers keep duping us? I'm sick of it, you got to do something.'' He said turning to his boss. ''-Speed things up! Do your magic and flaunt that smile, whatever, just get me my damn guns already.''\n\n Sitting across from where he was standing Marighella calmly drank his morning coffee. ''-Take it easy Toledo, like divine providence your weapons will come, for now you should sharpen the strongest weapon you have.'' \n\n''-I can't sharpen a sniper rifle.'' Toledo replied with a smirk spreading across his fuming face. \n\n''-It's not a weapon of metal dear friend, but of flesh.'' Marighella said smiling \n\n''Our hands are what we really fight with, with them the destruction of worlds is possible.'' He then picked up a pen ''Take this pen, my hand can use it to write a letter, now its contents are up to me, I can uplift someone or I can tear them down, the end result depends on how I have manipulated the pen and thus the emotions of the receiver. Likewise your hands manipulate your guns into killing others even tho could simply disarm, scare or incapacitate them, but you're still limited to what's in front of you. \nWords don't have limited range, and don't need ammo to hurt. As we progress operations will get harder and guns more scarce, it will be up to you to use your gifts and weapons to the utmost, be clever and think dangerously.'' ''-Yeah yeah, Old Wise One, thank you for your little dose of wisdom, I am not sure I fully understand it. Now excuse me, I have a letter to write to tell that damn factory to get his guys moving, pens aren't as useful in a firefight.'' Toledo responded, picking up the pen and producing a paper from his pants pocket. \n\nMarighella just sighed and smiled knowing that what he had said had not fallen on deaf ears, just stubborn ones. ''Oh...'' He thought..."

SAO_MARIGHELLA.3.t:0 "No Land, No Head, No Hope"
SAO_MARIGHELLA.3.d:0 "Marighella sat at a small dining room table, sipping coffee and reading one of several newspapers that he had, the morning sun peering gently onto the pages. Currently, he was authorizing defense preparations and preparing to meet with his lieutenants, the subject of such meeting and this morning's read being the M.S.T., the ''Movement of the Landless'', uprising and its unfortunate timing. \n\n''-An opening has been given and taken.” he thought, \n\n''-But this is bad, people are tearing each other in the streets, the state is risking a collapse of authority o or military intervention, protests are uncontrollable and the A.L.N. has no way of taking advantage of this.'' ''-But that is simply the human condition.'' \n\nMarighella sighed neatly, folding the newspaper he was reading and unfolding another. The front headline caught his eye \n''MST MEMBERS TESTIFY, REVEALS BOOGIEMAN FORCED THEIR HAND''. \n''-What?''\n\nThe article detailed the testimonies of various high-ranking M.S.T. members and how the A.L.N. plotted and forced their uprising as well as various reprisal attacks on police and civilians supposedly ordered by him. Marighella was perplexed, but his mind wandered, if the A.L.N. had ordered any of this he would know it, he would have been the one to give the order, he could have, but not now, it wasn't the time yet. Now not only was an opportunity missed but now funds and support were cut off from meaningful expansion. To add to that someone was giving orders without him it seemed, but the game goes on, and with betrayal and loss comes opportunity. \nOpportunity... Maybe this was the best he would ever have. \n\n''-The countryside is already in chaos, the loyalty of the M.S.T. was already in question, maybe the best chance for Revolution is to bet everything now and go with the flow and rise up prematurely while we still have their support...'' He contemplated. \n\n''-No, someone is trying to force my hand, I can't risk it all now, we must wait and let the landless be martyrs.''"

SAO_MARIGHELLA.4.d:0 "Toledo thundered down the streets, panic and adrenaline coursing throughout his body. \n\n''-Shit, fuck, Figueiredo's horse fucking cunt, how could I miss.'' he thought to himself as he rounded a dark corner. \nEverything had all gone to plan up until that moment, the one moment that had to go right. \n\n''-Maybe I should have sharpened my rifle as Marighella said.'' he thought, \n\n''-Wait no that's not what he meant.'' \n\nAs Toledo rounded another corner he nearly ran face first into a figure that stood in his way. \nA man all clad in black, cape blowing in the wind and face obscured by the shade cast by his hat. \n\n''-Who are you what do you want, I'll fucking kill you if you try to stop me make no mistake.''  Toledo said pulling out his pistols. The man replied \n\n"-I am justice" before pulling out a machine gun from his coat and leveling it at Toledo's head. \nToledo opened fire, each bullet hit its mark, and yet the man in black didn't even flinch, his grin soon faded and Toledo broke into a sprint firing madly behind him, going inside the nearest building, bashing doors and tripping up staircases. The figure followed, reaching him on the rooftop, he raised his gun and nailed Toledo in the shoulder and the back, knocking him down. \n\n''You're going to pay for that!'' Toledo said through grinding teeth, drawing a smoke grenade from his vest. \nIt went off clouding both in white smoke, the man in the Black Cape stepped into it, firing madly into the cloud and the pouring rain. A knife slid into the man's back sending him sprawling, his elbow flew back knocking 2 teeth out of Toledo and sending him to the ground, he leveled his machinegun to the Guerrilheiro's face, Toledo did the same with his Rifle in return. \n\nClick. Click. \n\nBoth guns were silent, only stares were exchanged, for the first time, the ALN general felt fear. \n\nThe man in the Black Cape stepped back into the rain and smoke, disappearing into the black rain.\n\nToledo stood still on the floor, bleeding, hurting, thinking. \n\n''-Who the fuck was that.''"
