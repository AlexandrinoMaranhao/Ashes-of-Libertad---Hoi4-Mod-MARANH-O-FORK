 BM_AMAZONIA_AZUL_DESC:0 "In the dark and forgotten jungle life goes on as it always has, cruel, brutish and short, riverside city states raid each other for food and guns while men in suits prosper from the revived rubber trade fueled by slave labour, in this age of petty squabbles for survival all set their sights on the heart of the Amazon, because all rivers lead to Manaus."
 BM_BRAZUKA_DESC:0 "The Brazilian giant lies exhausted and defeated by itself, years of fighting turned the once green fields and prosperous cities of the southeast into grey featureless rubble and from it new players arise to challenge the old republic and the greater state for the right to rule Brazil."
 
 ##Amazonia Blues descs
 #MNS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The beating heart of the Amazonian jungle, Manaus stands as a beacon of prosperity shinning over all the new world, based on corruption and misery, profiting from the rebirthed rubber trade and it's dark and exploitative production, the question now stands, what to do with this newfound wealth? Make ourselves into a shinning city on the jungle or reshape the amazon into our personal corporate playground?"
 #ACR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny Republic of Acre is the spirit of the age made manifest, born in fire, among the flying reds of revolution and the rushing blacks of reaction. It stands alone in the heart of the Amazon, surrounded by communists, bandits, and savages that roam the dark jungles and the halls of congress. Its future is torn between those who wish to live a life of freedom and those who wish to capitalize on the lucrative rubber trade. Will it get lost in the jungle or will it shine brighter than the others?"
 #COR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While Manaus prospers in the apocalypse others around it fade into obscurity. When the government collapsed in '62 that spelled doom for many riverside communities that depended on it for it's basic needs for survival, but not this one, not while Mayor Alexandre Montoril is watching over it. Sacked by it's defenders, betrayed and abandoned by those who promised to offer a helping hand and left to rot and die in the jungle, the Pearl of Solimões must keep shining no matter the cost or be swallowed by the river forever."
 #BEM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Junta's most loyal pet has done a frankly terrible job at keeping order in Brazil's second largest state, falling into quiet anarchy as the state loses power and men by the day, but not for long, not if Jarbas can stop it. Recently appointed by President Castelo Branco himself to lead Pará and the Paraense people in these troubling times such task will be done be it by peace of by blood, whatever the case may be, order will, no, must be restored."
 #NHA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Amazonian Military Command is, in a way, a perfect reflex of Brazil as a whole. Missmanaged by it's leaders leading to complete collapse of it's military capabilites, internally divided and torn apart by political conflict and humiliated beyond comprehension being banished from it's own base of operations. The remaining armies of the once brave and proud branch of the Brazilian Military Commands now crowd themselves in the island city of Nhamundá, waiting for a miracle to arrive."
 #ROR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The northernmost bastion of communism in Brazil, the Roraima Worker's Front is another child of the Junta's missmanadgement of it's own military forces and the unlikely friendship between an ex-soldier and an Acrean syndicalist. It's very existence however is even more unlikely and depends completely on the weak hold of a single battalion over an ignorant population of a state that has already fallen appart."
 #"The Second Brazilian Republic is broken, but not yet dead. Luck had never been on their side since the beginning of the civil war that shattered Brazil, support for President Goulart grows weaker by the day as the elections are postponed again and again, and after the betrayal of São Paulo makes so democracy seems more of a lost cause then ever before, in the backstage new and old characters draft their own plans and solutions to save Brazil in their own way, even if they have to put out the republican fire in order to build a new Brazil."
 #"The Junta is barely a country, held together by the pretense of saviors of Brazil against the Red Menace and the iron grip of the army, the unorganized and chaotic coup being largely responsible for the continuous loses of the army against much weaker revolts and the constant infighting between members of the military, it's mismanagement caused large chunks of the country to fall into anarchy and into the hands of warlords, colonels and any kind of local authority unless directly occupied by the army, so much for saviors."
 #"A subdivision of the Greater Military Junta that operates almost independently under the guidance of General Hugo De Andrade Abreu, a WW2 veteran turned public figure as a propaganda effort to increase popular support of the Junta, the 36° Battalion is now a household name being known nationally as Brazil's finest warriors, having held off the Miner's Revolt for months and secured the Mineiro Triangle, a region of huge strategic and economic importance, but time, money and fame can change anyone and the stoic figure of Abreu is quickly starting to fade under the promise of wealth far beyond what the Junta can give him."
 #"Pushed out of Minas Gerais by the reds, having it's supply lines with Brasília cut and having lost the First Battle of Guanabara, the Eastern Military command is battered, undersupplied and most importantly, humiliated, it's only respect worthy asset being the Navy, possibly the mightiest in the Americas and led by Admiral Augusto Rademaker, de facto leader of the Eastern Military command given the state of it's ground forces, it falls to his hands the responsibility of making this chapter of the Junta fight worthy again and take back what they lost, or desert from it and make something new like many sailors have done before."
