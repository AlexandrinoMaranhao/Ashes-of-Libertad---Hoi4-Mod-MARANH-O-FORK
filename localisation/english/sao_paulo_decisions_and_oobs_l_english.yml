 sao_resettling_riograndeses_desc:0 "There has always been beef between the Paulista and Gaúcho populace, sometimes because of literal beef, this is one of those times. As the war tightens the grip around the neck of the §G4th Brazilian Republic§! food rations have become scarcer and scarcer, drawing many hungry souls to the rogue state of §OSão Paulo§!. \n\nBy resettling them we can accommodate the most desirable members of the migrating flock and absorb them into the §OConstitutionalist Revolution§!. \n\n§tATTENTION!§! \n\nFocusing on foreigners will upset the lower classes of the Paulista People and may trigger an §tUprising§!."
 sao_resettling_cariocas_desc:0 "Cariocas and Paulistas have been enemies since times immemorial, but desperate times demand desperate measures.

Lack of supervision risks allowing enemies of the Revolution inside our borders, so it is in our best interest to keep a close eye on them.\n\nBy resettling them we can accommodate the most desirable members of the migrating flock and absorb them into the §OConstitutionalist Revolution§!. \n\n§tATTENTION!§! \n\nFocusing on foreigners will upset the lower classes of the Paulista People and may trigger an §tUprising§!."

 sao_resettling_northeastern_desc:0 "Although we may try to hide it, our glory was built on the back of cheap labor, on the sweat of those more desperate or choiceless.

 sao_resettling_europeans_desc:0 "The history of European migration to §OSão Paulo§! is as long as its existence, nowadays proud communities of Italians, Spanish, Portuguese, Germans and many others dominate the state. Since the §tApocalypse§!, however, boats departing from Lisbon have brought thousands upon thousands of European immigrants to the shores of §GBrazil§!, coming from a much more diverse pool of ethnicities and backgrounds. \nAny change to the European status quo of §OSão Paulo§! is sure to cause turmoil with the already established communities, but the newcomers do bring with them important technologies not found anywhere else in Latin America that we could take advantage of.\n\nBy resettling them we can accommodate the most desirable members of the migrating flock and absorb them into the §OConstitutionalist Revolution§!. \n\n§tATTENTION!§! \n\nFocusing on foreigners will upset the lower classes of the Paulista People and may trigger an §tUprising§!."
 sao_resettling_americans_desc:0 "After the §tApocalypse§!, §3American Communities§! sprouted across Latin America, crossing the Darian straight in search of a new destiny to manifest.
