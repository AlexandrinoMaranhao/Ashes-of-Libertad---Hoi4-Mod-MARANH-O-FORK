CFD_sampaiosadminstration_desc:0 "Sampaio’s extensive economic knowledge and innovative ideas will be game changing in the process of modernizing the northeast and reducing our economic dependence on imported goods as much as possible. Thank God he didn’t stay with ARENA!"
CFD_autonomy_to_small_business:0 "Autonomy to Small Business"
CFD_autonomy_to_small_business_desc:0 "Currently, the state administers many small shops and markets, being able to set fixed prices to many goods. This was initially put into place due to the 1962 famine to reduce food prices, but since the situation has been mostly controlled the need for such measure is no longer existent, meaning we can relax our grip in the markets and grant autonomy to these small businessmans, reducing the stress put into our bureaucracy and increasing the profits of the small companies."
CFD_forced_industrialization:0 "Forced Industrialization"
CFD_forced_industrialization_desc:0 "Although natural growth is the optimal course of things, we cannot depend on the markets to create industries quickly enough to match our increasingly greater needs. We must start a state-sponsored industrialization process if we ever expect to get close to the powers that are around us, just like Vargas did!"
CFD_thecreationofssocoperbess:0 "The Creation of §OCOPERBE§!"
CFD_thecreationofssocoperbess_desc:0 "Our diligence towards fuel self-sufficiency has finally paid itself off! With the creation of COPERBE within our immediate reach, we will be able to refine sugar cane not only into sugar, but also in gasoline to fill our cars with patriotic (but mostly cheap) fuel! This is no doubt great news to our state of affairs, and will indirectly fill our citizens' pockets with a little bit more of money after the end of the very expensive fuel imports."
CFD_anotherdayintheoffice:0 "Another Day in the Office..."
CFD_anotherdayintheoffice_desc:0 "Another day, another paper to sign and things to officialize. When Arraes agreed to become the president of the confederation, he definitely did not notice that creating a nation from scratch is not just hard, but it requires a lot of paperwork to get everything you need sorted. At least he knows that after today he’s gonna have a lot of people helping him with that."
CFD_investing_in_basic_infrastructure:0 "Investing in Basic Infrastructure"
CFD_investing_in_basic_infrastructure_desc:0 "The neglect that the northeastern region went through in pretty much its entire history after the decline of the sugar cycle has made it so that the mud/gravel road is the only true constant outside of the bigger cities, and after the sertaneja revolution the damage to these old structures has made it even worse. It’s more than due that we fix our roads and trains, to make sure every good and person is able to be transported safely and in a timely manner."
CFD_the_everyday_fuel:0 "The Everyday Fuel"
CFD_the_everyday_fuel_desc:0 "For us to be able to start even the most basic motorization efforts, fuel must be our greatest of priorities. Unfortunately, we currently rely on imports to get it, with the noble exception of the Rio Grande do Norte’s high oil reserves descovered sometime after the confederation. Nonetheless, we must spend a great deal of funds to get our needs sorted. This situation must be dealt with as soon as possible."
CFD_foundssgbandecosess:0 "Found §GBANDECOSE§!"
CFD_foundssgbandecosess_desc:0 "In order to make sure our economic ventures work the way they should, a central bank will be the most logical institution to be implemented in our set of state organizations. The Bank of Development of The Sertaneja Confederation will have the authority to issue funds, increase interest rates and many other measures, as any central bank in a modern nation would be able to."
CFD_reopening_military_academies_in_recife:0 "Re-opening Military Academies in Recife"
CFD_reopening_military_academies_in_recife_desc:0 "The 6th Military region may have lacked the power to actually stop us, but they surely had more than enough time to make sure that the old academies that were in Recife would not be able to get back into operation in a very long time. Unfortunately for them, we were the ones that built Brasília, and a school or two won’t take us time at all to get back in shape, even if they had nuked it somehow! And also, we really need our soldiers and officers to know a thing or two of how to fire guns and how to encircle units, so it's in our best of interests to fix those schools."
CFD_legalize_gunsmiths_workshops_in_fortaleza:0 "Legalize Gunsmiths Workshops in Fortaleza"
CFD_legalize_gunsmiths_workshops_in_fortaleza_desc:0 "There are numerous gunsmiths in Fortaleza, and right now, all of them are both totally illegal and also one of our main sources of weapons. At this point, it’s useless to fight it, we might as well legalize them and oversee their operation instead of insisting that every gun-making operation must be controlled directly by the state. Well, that is as long as they don't sell weapons to our enemies."

CFD_spending_the_fortunes_desc:0 "Sampaio has a few ideas of how to reduce the importation of fuel from abroad, but unfortunately it will require a fortune to be achieved. Well, if we get what we want from it, it will pay itself back anyway, so it's a venture worth diving into."
CFD_establishing_a_new_currency:0 "Establishing A New Currency"
CFD_establishing_a_new_currency_desc:0 "Since the day we split from the rule of Brasília, the old brazilian currency\nfell into disuse almost immediately, and then we regressed back into bartering, a pretty basic and non effective means of trading. If we are to truly become a modern nation, we must once again adopt a standardized currency, otherwise we might slip all the way back to a feudal society!"
