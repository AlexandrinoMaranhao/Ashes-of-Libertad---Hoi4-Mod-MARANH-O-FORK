FRN_the_isolated_garrison_desc:0 "The defeat of the 6th Military region may have expulsed most of the Brazillian army outside the northeast, but to the few soldiers that stayed in Fernando de Noronha, the fight goes on as if nothing had happened. Having pretty much every supply line with the continent cut off, their only mean of survival is through becoming 'pirates'. They constantly harass civilian boats, those being refugees from Europe or fisher boats from the Confederacy, as long they are not Junta, it does not matter at all."
