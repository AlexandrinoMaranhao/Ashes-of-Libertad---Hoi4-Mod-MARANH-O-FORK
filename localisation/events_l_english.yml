 CoariIntroduction.1.t:0 "How did we get here?"
 CoariIntroduction.1.d:0 "The River of Gold, the Land of Gas, River of the Gods, The Pearl of Solimões; Those are all names once given to the city of Coari, the 5th largest and one of the most isolated towns in northern Brazil, located just west of Manaus in the dense heart of the Amazon rainforest, but what makes this city shine also came to be it's own downfall, following the 1962 military coup that deposed President João Goulart and the following civil war that still rages on, Coari came to be one of the cities occupied by the Amazonian Military Command, one of the Brazilian Army's regional defence forces, in an effort to maintain peace during a time of crisis.\n \nIn 1965 however with the prolongment of the war, infighting between Junta and Loyalist forces inside the ranks of the Amazonian Military Command and the lack of men in the southern frontlines forced it to be recalled from Coari and the Amazon as a whole, stationed only in Manaus, Parintins, Nhamundá and Belém, however their mark stayed behind.\n \nBe it for lack of supervision, overdeployment, undersupplying of troops or a combination of all made so the army's treatment of the civilian population turned harsher and harser by the day, beatings on the streets and sporadic fire were seen around the city between loyalist and Junta aligned soldiers, with civilians getting caught in the crossfire, such horrors however cannot compare to what came on March 1st 1965, 3 days before the troops retreat from the the Amazon and 1 day before the start of the Carnaval.\n \nDuring a communal dinner organized by the local church as a departure gift for the soldiers, unbeknowst to all, liquor got smuggled in, men got drunk, tensions escalated and soon blood was shed and by the end of the night the Solimões river reflected the orange light of the burning city.\n \nThe pillaging carried on for a day, few houses were spared, women were stripped from their husbands and children; The following day the soldiers departed earlier then expected, carrying with them trophies as if taken from life long enemy's homes, and the Pearl of Solimões was left behind without it's shine."

 CoariIntroduction.2.t:0 "The Pearl of Solimões"
 CoariIntroduction.2.d:0 "If you go up the Amazon river departing from Manaus there isn't much to see besides the seemingly endless torrent of dark brown water ahead of you and the lush green forest surrounding you, at least for the untrained eye that is, those who can appreciate it's beauty may notice the endless colorful tropical birds dotting the sky every sunset and sunrise in great flocks, the alien like lifestyle of the villages of interconnect stilt houses living off the rivers, and after a whole day of travel the meeting point where the dark waters of the Negro river meet with the calm, light brown Solimões at the birthplace of the Amazon.\n \nIf you decide to turn left and go up the muddy brown waters of the Solimões however you will be surprised with what you find, for in the heart of that dense isolated jungle lives a treasure of inimmaginabile value, a pearl that shines so bright it's light guides the lost like a lighthouse towards the warm welcoming embrace of a kind and hardworking people, and it's name is Coari.\n \nA wonder built by God fearing men who like the pioneers of the American Frontier dedicated their lives to settling this wild land and taming it into something worth calling home, and by God they did it, the Harbor is the gateway from which the stones that built the Colonial style Getúlio Vargas Square and the pride of the town, the Friary of Sant'Anna, where man from all over the world teach and guide a new generation of priests."
 CoariIntroduction.2.A:0 "Truly one of the Amazon's many beauties"
 CoariIntroduction.3.t:0 "The White Linned Mayor"
 CoariIntroduction.3.d:0 "Born in the dry and misery-fertile lands of the Brazilian northeast, Montoril quickly fell in love with the wet and mysterious north when he moved there at an early age, his childhood however would not be an easy or happy one becoming an orphan and having to look after his brothers working as a black and goldsmith, police officer, dentist and finally enrolling in politics during the short lived tenentist levants of '32, when he became Military Mayor of Coari following the murder of it's former mayor, that however sparked his legendary career in Coarense politics and the Golden age of the city that, under his guidance, has managed to thrive for decades and emerge with prominence from the deep, dark jungle. As an old man in '61 he was elected again as mayor after a long hiatus from politics as if destiny itself put him in charge of his beloved little town once again in a time of desperation. During Coari's sacking on March 1st 1965 his reign almost came to a bloody end if not for the civilian mob that surrounded and protected him and his office during the chaos, a showcase of the people's gratitude and love for him. To anyone outside of the now desolate city this may seems... weird, but the undeniable only reason Coari still stands, even if only half alive, is the presence and guidance of this well dressed man.
 CoariIntroduction.3.A:0 "Charming fella"
 Coari.6.t:0 "Fish and Bananas"
 Coari.6.d:0 "The door to Montoril's office was heavily guarded day and night, the guards never had to do anything but look angrily at people that came too close, but they nonetheless carried military assalt rifles scavenged from the Carnaval sacking all those years ago, still, those are hardly necessary, no one would ever dare to do any harm to the mayor, still Montoril insisted on having them watch over him day and night.\nThe door opened slightly, the face of one of the guards swooped in.\n''Sir, Father Hirsch has paid you a visit.''\n \nMontoril rose his head from the letter he spent the last hours drafting, visibly surprised by the visitor.\n''Hirsch? What is he doing here at this time of night, shouldn't he be at the dinner?''\n \n''That's... why he came sir, you haven't shown up there for more then a month now, he brought you something to eat.''\nThe lack of formalities wasn't seen as disrespect by Montoril in any way, those men cared for him like a son cares for his father, and he understood that, the guard opened the door, revealing a platter of cooked bananas and fish wrapped in a white cloth, still steaming hot, not fancy but that's all they had now.\n''Should I leave it at your table or...''\n \n''No, no'' Montoril interrupted, he sighed looking at the piles of useless drafts and unsent letters addressed to Brasília, it's weird to think that while trying to help the town he distanced himself from it's people, always locked in his office, always drafting another plan to make them last one more week afloat.\n \n''Has Hirsch left the building yet?'' He asked.\n \nThe guard looked back for a moment to check. ''I believe not sir, I can hear his voice downstairs.'' The guard replied."

 Coari.1.t:0 "It's a long, long way to Santarém"
 Coari.1.d:0 "''How long will the journey take?'' Asked the old lady.\n \n''If we're luck just 4 days but with canoes I doubt it will be so quick, specially with all the weight.'' Answered the young man. ''Don't worry mom, I'll be fine.'\n \nHe held her wrinkled hands together in a caring gesture looking her gently in the eyes. ''I'll be back by the end of the week, don't worry, no one will risk their lives for a fancy sofa and a new pair of shoes.''\n \nHe smiled proudly of his own joke but it had no effect on the old lady, she stuttered for a moment not knowing what to say, alternating her attention between her son and the canoes and small vessels filled to the brim with furniture, chests carrying small useless trinkets and few things with actual value.\n \n''You are not coming back, are you son?''\n \n''Of course I a-''\n \n''You didn't load anything to sell in Santarém besides your clothes, you're not going there to pay the militia, you're leaving us, aren't you son?''\n \nLurdes could be old but she kept her smarts and she knew her son well, while leaving he made the effort of not taking anything valuable to her, only his personal belongings, she knew damn well what was happening.\n \n''Mother, I... This city is dead, there's no hope left here anymore just look at what we are doing! Praying to god that a bunch of payed murderers will save us from getting murdered in exchange for our fucki- damned wardrobes.'' He gripped her harder. ''Once I get to Santarém I'll take a boat to Manaus, find a job in the plantations or maybe as a soldier of fortune, I will come back for you I promise but I can't stay in Coari anymore.''\n \nTears started to sprout in both as the weight of the lie came crashing down, the old lady held her son's hand against her face one last time and reached for something in her pocket, taking out a small silver object.\n \n''You forgot your father's tie clip in the drawer, I hoped you would get married wearing it just like he did but it may be worth something."\n She put it in his hand and closed it tight.\n \n''I didn't forget it mother...''"
 Coari.1.A:0 "''...I wanted you to have something to remember me and father.''"
