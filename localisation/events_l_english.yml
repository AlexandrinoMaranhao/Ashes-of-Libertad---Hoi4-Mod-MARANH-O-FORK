 CoariIntroduction.1.t:0 "How did we get here?"
 CoariIntroduction.1.d:0 "The River of Gold, the Land of Gas, River of the Gods, The Pearl of Solimões; Those are all names once given to the city of Coari, the 5th largest and one of the most isolated towns in northern Brazil, located just west of Manaus in the dense heart of the Amazon rainforest, but what makes this city shine also came to be it's own downfall, following the 1962 military coup that deposed President João Goulart and the following civil war that still rages on, Coari came to be one of the cities occupied by the Amazonian Military Command, one of the Brazilian Army's regional defence forces, in an effort to maintain peace during a time of crisis.\n \nIn 1965 however with the prolongment of the war, infighting between Junta and Loyalist forces inside the ranks of the Amazonian Military Command and the lack of men in the southern frontlines forced it to be recalled from Coari and the Amazon as a whole, stationed only in Manaus, Parintins, Nhamundá and Belém, however their mark stayed behind.\n \nBe it for lack of supervision, overdeployment, undersupplying of troops or a combination of all made so the army's treatment of the civilian population turned harsher and harsher by the day, beatings on the streets and sporadic fire were seen around the city between loyalist and Junta aligned soldiers, with civilians getting caught in the crossfire, such horrors however cannot compare to what came on March 1st 1965, 3 days before the troops retreat from the the Amazon and 1 day before the start of the Carnaval.\n \nDuring a communal dinner organized by the local church as a departure gift for the soldiers, unbeknownst to all, liquor got smuggled in, men got drunk, tensions escalated and soon blood was shed and by the end of the night the Solimões river reflected the orange light of the burning city.\n \nThe pillaging carried on for a day, few houses were spared, women were stripped from their husbands and children; The following day the soldiers departed earlier than expected, carrying with them trophies as if taken from life long enemy's homes, and the Pearl of Solimões was left behind without it's shine."

 CoariIntroduction.2.d:0 "If you go up the Amazon river departing from Manaus there isn't much to see besides the seemingly endless torrent of dark brown water ahead of you and the lush green forest surrounding you, at least for the untrained eye that is, those who can appreciate it's beauty may notice the endless colorful tropical birds dotting the sky every sunset and sunrise in great flocks, the alien like lifestyle of the villages of interconnect stilt houses living off the rivers, and after a whole day of travel the meeting point where the dark waters of the Negro river meet with the calm, light brown Solimões at the birthplace of the Amazon.\n \nIf you decide to turn left and go up the muddy brown waters of the Solimões however you will be surprised with what you find, for in the heart of that dense isolated jungle lives a treasure of inimmaginabile value, a pearl that shines so bright it's light guides the lost like a lighthouse towards the warm welcoming embrace of a kind and hardworking people, and it's name is Coari.\n \nA wonder built by God fearing men who like the pioneers of the American Frontier dedicated their lives to settling this wild land and taming it into something worth calling home, and by God they did it, the Harbor is the gateway from which the stones that built the Colonial style Getúlio Vargas Square and the pride of the town, the Friary of Sant'Anna came from, where man from all over the world teach and guide a new generation of priests."

 CoariIntroduction.3.t:0 "The White Linned Mayor."
 CoariIntroduction.3.d:0 "Born in the dry and misery-fertile lands of the Brazilian northeast, Montoril quickly fell in love with the wet and mysterious north when he moved there at an early age, his childhood however would not be an easy or happy one becoming an orphan and having to look after his brothers working as a black and goldsmith, police officer, dentist and finally enrolling in politics during the short lived tenentist levants of '32, when he became Military Mayor of Coari following the murder of it's former mayor, that however sparked his legendary career in Coarense politics and the Golden age of the city that, under his guidance, has managed to thrive for decades and emerge with prominence from the deep, dark jungle. As an old man in '61 he was elected again as mayor after a long hiatus from politics as if destiny itself put him in charge of his beloved little town once again in a time of desperation. During Coari's sacking on March 1st 1965 his reign almost came to a bloody end if not for the civilian mob that surrounded and protected him and his office during the chaos, a showcase of the people's gratitude and love for him. To anyone outside of the now desolate city this may seems... weird, but the undeniable only reason Coari still stands, even if only half alive, is the presence and guidance of this well dressed man.
 CoariIntroduction.3.A:0 "Charming fella"
 Coari.4.t:0 "Fish and Bananas."
 Coari.4.d:0 "The door to Montoril's office was heavily guarded day and night, the guards never had to do anything but look angrily at people that came too close, but they nonetheless carried military assalt rifles scavenged from the Carnaval sacking all those years ago, still, those are hardly necessary, no one would ever dare to do any harm to the mayor, still Montoril insisted on having them watch over him day and night.\nThe door opened slightly, the face of one of the guards swooped in.\n''Sir, Father Hirsch has paid you a visit.''\n \nMontoril rose his head from the letter he spent the last hours drafting, visibly surprised by the visitor.\n''Hirsch? What is he doing here at this time of night, shouldn't he be at the dinner?''\n \n''That's... why he came sir, you haven't shown up there for more then a month now, he brought you something to eat.''\nThe lack of formalities wasn't seen as disrespect by Montoril in any way, those men cared for him like a son cares for his father, and he understood that, the guard opened the door, revealing a platter of cooked bananas and fish wrapped in a white cloth, still steaming hot, not fancy but that's all they had now.\n''Should I leave it at your table or...''\n \n''No, no'' Montoril interrupted, he sighed looking at the piles of useless drafts and unsent letters addressed to Brasília, it's weird to think that while trying to help the town he distanced himself from it's people, always locked in his office, always drafting another plan to make them last one more week afloat.\n \n''Has Hirsch left the building yet?'' He asked.\n \nThe guard looked back for a moment to check. ''I believe not sir, I can hear his voice downstairs.'' The guard replied."

 Coari.2.d:0 "''Hey, do you want to be a man? If yes, you need to hold this gun and fire.'' \n \nThat was Arthur, Montoril's mouthpiece for getting some new people to the Coari Defense Militia, brigade number 2, platoon number 1. The young man who held the rifle barely expected the weight going against his shoulder and body, breathing in carefully to save face, trying to look as manly as possible. He looked forward to the target - a small bottle, rusted and forgotten by time - and breathed out, firing the spare bullet against the bottle, the caliber slowly entering the glass and shattering it into a million pieces. The young man lost his balance due to the recoil, running back and his ear ringing from the loud crackle of the rifle's bolt. His friends looked and laughed at him, yet their turn was coming too. The second young man came, confident and ready to shoot, reloading his bolt-action rifle and aiming to the second bottle. He aimed with certainty, and shot with the same certainty, the rifle making his arm lunge backwards and make him trip on himself. The last teenager, the most confident of them all, prepared his shot and fired at the third bottle. He stood triumphantly, looking at the shattered bottle and a small bird which he had also shot by accident."
 Coari.2.A:0 "We have a long way to go, kids."
 Coari.1.t:0 "It's a long, long way to Santarém."
 Coari.1.d:0 "''How long will the journey take?'' Asked the old lady.\n \n''If we're luck just 4 days but with canoes I doubt it will be so quick, specially with all the weight.'' Answered the young man. ''Don't worry mom, I'll be fine.'\n \nHe held her wrinkled hands together in a caring gesture looking her gently in the eyes. ''I'll be back by the end of the week, don't worry, no one will risk their lives for a fancy sofa and a new pair of shoes.''\n \nHe smiled proudly of his own joke but it had no effect on the old lady, she stuttered for a moment not knowing what to say, alternating her attention between her son and the canoes and small vessels filled to the brim with furniture, chests carrying small useless trinkets and few things with actual value.\n \n''You are not coming back, are you son?''\n \n''Of course I a-''\n \n''You didn't load anything to sell in Santarém besides your clothes, you're not going there to pay the militia, you're leaving us, aren't you son?''\n \nLurdes could be old but she kept her smarts and she knew her son well, while leaving he made the effort of not taking anything valuable to her, only his personal belongings, she knew damn well what was happening.\n \n''Mother, I... This city is dead, there's no hope left here anymore just look at what we are doing! Praying to god that a bunch of payed murderers will save us from getting murdered in exchange for our fucki- damned wardrobes.'' He gripped her harder. ''Once I get to Santarém I'll take a boat to Manaus, find a job in the plantations or maybe as a soldier of fortune, I will come back for you I promise but I can't stay in Coari anymore.''\n \nTears started to sprout in both as the weight of the lie came crashing down, the old lady held her son's hand against her face one last time and reached for something in her pocket, taking out a small silver object.\n \n''You forgot your father's tie clip in the drawer, I hoped you would get married wearing it just like he did but it may be worth something."\n She put it in his hand and closed it tight.\n \n''I didn't forget it mother...''"

 ACRIntroduction.3.t:0 "The white liquid of life."
 ACRIntroduction.1.d:0 "In the eve of the 19th century the revolutionary ideals of France and the liberal optimism of the United States made their way into the deep dark Bolivian jungle, giving birth to the first Republic of Acre, based on surprisingly modern ideals for such a backwaters place and time. \nNonetheless the light of such revolution would be quickly and repeatedly snuff out, first by the Bolivians, then Brazilians, and 3 more times the Republic would rise just to be stomped back into being a historical footnote in the history of Latin American republics, but even after it's visionary leaders are all long dead and buried and it's flags stolen and re appropriated the ideals created by this 'footnote' lives on to this day in the minds of the educated folk. \n \nIn 1962 the world would be brought to its knees and in the process tyranny would again come to Rio Branco, ironically though the same fire responsible for ending the mighty republics of France and America also rekindled the fires of revolution in the deep secluded Brazilian jungle."
 ACRIntroduction.2.d:0 "In 1962 federal troops marched on the streets of Brasília announcing the army coup, while some resisted and still resist to this day the state of Acre, elevated to a state from a Federal Territory just one year prior, was quickly overwhelmed by the local Junta Loyal garrison of the 4th Frontier Battalion who sieged Rio Branco Palace until the then governor, José Augusto de Araújo, surrendered peacefully to the federal troops passing the title of Governor to Edgar Cerqueira and being taken to Brasília to await judgement in prison. \nHowever, as conflicts against Republican forces escalated into open civil war Acre's military occupation by the Amazonian Military Command came to an abrupt end when the occupation force was recalled from the state to serve more actively in the war, leaving the rebellious state essentially independent, but also very, very vulnerable. \nAs soon as the Brazilian troops left danger came from Bolivia once again as Che Guevara's ragtag of guerrilla fighters pushed north into Brazil, being bravely (and miraculously) stopped in Brasiléia by a combined force of civilian militias and the former 4th Frontier Battalion, and in the wake of such victory Acrean nationalism was catapulted back into mainstream, Edgar's military government became more of a suggestion then rule as his forces were now outnumbered and outgunned by victorious proud militia man, and seeing themselves abandoned by the Brazilian Government and with a renewed sense of national pride Acre declared its formal independence from Brazil, taking its first step towards a becoming the America's newest Republic."
 ACRIntroduction.3.d:0 "Latex is the blood of the Republic, for millennia before the arrival of Europeans natives would turn it into balls for the children to play or use it for basic repairs and tool making, in the 19th century this industry boomed as vehicles and machines in Europe and the United States now required rubber to function, bringing much wealth to those who sold it and much suffering for those who harvest it. \nAs expected the republic's economy isn't an industrial one, far from it, instead Acre's economy is entirely dependent on the renewed rubber trade which while profitable (specially after the complete collapse of the production of synthetic rubber in Europe and the US) is also a very, very exploitative job, tappers are constantly being exposed to every danger the jungle can offer from disease to wild animals, often away from city centers where medical help can be offered if ever needed, wages are low and life conditions even worse not to mention the impact these rubber plantations have on nature and the native communities that cover much of Acre's territory. \nThese inhuman conditions are fundamentally against the original beliefs of the Republic but still we are dependent on trade with Manaus if we want to prosper and grow in power and relevance, time will tell if the ideals of old will be upheld or forgotten when faced with reality."

 ACR.1.d:0 "With all senators united in Rio Branco work on the Constitution has begun, while the ideals of the original Acre Republic are highly regarded amongst all, and the old laws imposed by the Brazilian Government are still used as a basis, this is a time of great change and radical unexpected reforms could end up being put in place if so desired by the senators. \n \nThe 22 senators here united come from all parts of Acre and some are even from beyond it's borders, as a result no one has any strong relationship with anyone else, mix that with the fact that Acre doesn't have a strong political history makes so there are no existing parties those senators can affiliate themselves with, instead, new parties are being created as the constitution is written and senators get to meet each other, grouping into 3 groups of like minded individuals, the Nationalists, who value the original values of the Republic and are united by a strong sense of national pride, the Militarists, mainly members of the former 4th Frontier Battalion or militia members bitter from the attack from Ce Guevara who believe the only way to save Acre's sovereignty is my turning it into a true fighting force capable of defending itself, and the Technocrats, a loose group of intellectuals, poets, artists and social activists coming from the lower levels of society, while some brand them as communist they advocate for better more humane work conditions for tappers and much needed social reforms. \n \nOnce the constitution is signed an indirect election will take place where the senators will vote for one of them to become president, the candidate of the party with most seats will be granted the honor of becoming the first President of the Acre Republic, finally ending the period of Provisional Government."
 ACR.2.d:0 "The Senate has come to the conclusion that integrating the native communities into "civilized" world is not something we can afford to do, at least not in the present time, such worries are mainly good hearted however with few talks of "racial superiority", concerns are mainly economical and of the well being of the native communities as integrating them would not only disturb their traditional way of life but also expose them to disease and exploitation from land lords, they are best left alone, the question is, how alone?"
 ACR.3.d:0 "Talks of equality have won the Senate, while some argue that complete integration of the natives could cause a disturbance of their traditional way of life and exposition to unnecessary evils, it was ultimately decided that all men are equal inside the Republic independent of color, language or birthplace, however even inside the Senate racism against native Americans is very much present, the question now is if those ideals of equality should be forced and indoctrinated into the population's mindset or only enforced by law."
 ACR.4.d:0 "Words are dangerous, Brazil's failure in stopping the spread of ideas was what created the Acre Republic in the first place and in an ironic twist we must not commit the same mistake as them, the state needs a strong hand over the few media outlets it has at its disposal, the question is how hard should we grip them?"

 ACR.7.d:0 "The elefant in the room, worker's rights, heated debate between Technocrats and the rest eventually culminated into a victory for the social justice warriors, a not insignificant step towards betterment of the people's lifes, the question now is, how hard should we push those reforms?"
 ACR.8.d:0 "The days following the withdrawal of federal troops from Acre were days of chaos and desperation, Edgar's authority broke down as the people organized into militias for and against Ce Guevara's iminent invasion, fighting between syndicalist tapper militias led by Wilson de Souza and the former 4th Frontier Battalion broke out in the streets of Xapuri, and once the main attacking force from the red army came intense resistance was made on Brasiléia and Rio Branco, ultimately repelling Ce's forces and saving Acre from a fate akin to Rondônia's in a glorious although costly victory, Wilson was banished from Acre, the Republic was consolidated and Ce Guevara went back to Bolivia to lick his wounds, a tense peace now exists, another attack in the near future seems eminent and Ce's forces grow stronger by the day, we all wait and pray that when the day comes we are able to best them back once again."
 ACR.9.d:0 "Acting as independent defense forces, many militias still roam the country side vowing to protect citizens from the red Menace to the south, still such unregulated fighting force is prone to making "unfortunate accidents" like shooting civilians "accidentally", occasionally looting entire villages or declaring innocent people enemies of the state and communist sympathizers, they have to be organized into a disciplined fighting force and fast before things spiral out of control, and the first step in doing so is regulating recruitment."

The Technocrats prefer a lighter approach, by hiring foreign specialists from the former Brazilian Republic (And most controversially, ex soldiers defecting from Che Guevara's Army) and heavy police training, but while also keeping police corruption to a minimum by disbanding the militias and keeping stricter police regulations. The debate has been the topic of much interest in the country, or police reform could be just around the corner..."

His path to reach the halls of Palácio Rio Branco (Rio Branco Palace) wasn't free of obstacles, hardships and enemies, but where weak willed men would perish, Cury thrived and these unfavorable situations steeled his will to persist in the fight for an better Acre to all the Acreans, a cause to which he devoted himself since his youth. Although his political alignment leaning tends to the left, this presents no obstacle if the need to compromise with other political factions in order to do the reforms arise, as long as his ideas for the betterment of Acre, that include building a more equal and democratic Acre in synchrony with nature, opportunities and welfare for everyone prioritizing the most neglected parts of the Acrean population, to develop the industrial Acrean economy aiming to make it less reliant in rubber exploitation and other resource extractive activities. As a member of the Nationalist Party, he is willing to defend the Acrean emancipation until his last breath and will try to maintain the little charming boat that is Acre afloat through this nebulous times, using shrewd diplomacy to deal with our closest neighbors that could pose a threat to Acre or that can proportionate handsomely profitable economical partnerships.\n \nHélio Cury is often seen as a pacifist, a no-balls social-democrat within the militaristic inner circles, but something they don't deny is that his resolve can be a trump card if situation gets out of control."

 ACR_cury.2.t:0 "Regulating the Rubber Industry"
 ACR_cury.2.d:0 "The Acre Region has been a area of great rubber tapping activity since the second half of the nineteenth century, it lived through two Rubber Booms in the short space a hundred years and, even though the second Boom happened more than twenty years ago, most of the Acre's economy still gravitates around the recently revived rubber industry. Despite the economical importance of this industry, to an extent that any acrean could say that inside his blood vessels flown a mix of red blood and white latex, still operates in a primitive fashion, notably in the absence of any kind of labor rights legislation of the tappers, the abysmal social rift between the seringalistas and the tappers, whom worked to the seringlistas, and the permanent tying of the latter with the seringals where they worked by a system of permanent debt. The seringals are mostly private-owned unregulated rubber production plants composed by the central building called Barracão (The Shed), where everything that the tappers cannot produce by themselves is put on sale and all the rubber they produced is sold; Colocações (Locations), an area assigned for the tappers to build improvised shacks (Tapiris) to live with their families while working in the seringal; Estradas de Seringa (Rubber trees spot), obviously the place of the precious and toxic latex; for last but not least important O Defumador (The Smoker), whose function is to fume the látex until it turnes into pélas de borracha (thick rubber balls). Hélio has, as one of his first presidential acts, plans to draft the first regulation code of the rubber tapping industry ever made in order to ensure that better working conditions are achieved but foremost, besides drafting the code, is that he'll need to find common ground with some factions of the Acrean National Congress and compromise with them to pass his legislation."

 ACR_cury.3.t:0 "Compromising with the Technocrats" 
 ACR_cury.3.d:0 "Inside the halls and corridors of the Acrean National Congress (ANC), besides our natural nationalistas supporters, there are two other political factions with their own ideas about how improve and reform Acre, the Technocrats and the Militarists. The minimum legislative quorum required by our Constitution to ratify any new laws or acts is of two thirds plus one of the voting deputies in the national legislative therefore, even with full vote commitment of our party deputies, courting partial support from other factions is necessary to obtain enough votes for the passage of the juridical code known officially as the Rubber Industry Organic Regulation Act and informally, as the Curista 1st National Reform Act. To court them successfully, we need to accede some of their immediate demands. The so-called Technocracy Bloc, headed by the diarchy of Marques de Sousa and Éneas Carneiro, usually has a more friendly albeit paternalistic approach towards the autochthone tribes in Acre and has massive support in the working-class sectors and the most technical-educated circles of Acrean society, want the inclusion of a law prohibiting the Correrias, hit-and-run skirmishes against the indigenous populations with the objective of clearing resource-rich sites to facilitate their immediate or future extraction. They also want the inclusion of a kind of welfare net to alleviate the most poverty-stricken parts of the Acrean population, a more aggressive regulation and supervision of the working conditions inside the Seringais, base of the majority of our rubber production. We cannot afford to accede all these demands but a harsh legislation prohibiting the Correrias can be fitted inside the Act without much complaint of our own deputies and is enough to appease the majority of the Technocrats."

 ACR_cury.4.d:0 "Inside the halls and corridors of the Acrean National Congress (ANC), besides our natural nationalistas supporters, there are two other political factions with their own ideas about how improve and reform Acre, the Technocrats and the Militarists. The minimum legislative quorum required by our Constitution to ratify any new laws or acts is of two thirds plus one of the voting deputies in the national legislative therefore, even with full vote commitment of our party deputies, courting partial support from other factions is necessary to obtain enough votes for the passage of the juridical code known officially as the Rubber Industry Organic Regulation Act and informally, as the Curista 1st National Reform Act. To court them successfully, we need to accede some of their immediate demands.\nThe Militarists are headed by General Edgar Cerqueira, political body and voice of our most prominent military officials, are not exactly the most committed democrats in our country and to be honest, democracy is seen more as a nuisance to the majority of them as it hampers the creation of a great, prepared, equipped and well-oiled military apparatus in case Guevara tries to invade again. They want the hardening of both the stance and the approach towards the tapper rallies as the top brass of our military staff emphatically points those rallies as potential hotbeds for the spreading of more radical ideas done directly or indirectly by Guevarist agents and sympathisers infiltrated inside our nation and these same agitators could act as a fifth column inside Acre or even try to topple the government if they gather the support of enough disgruntled acreans. Other demands put forth by the militarist clique are a huge raise in the budget designated to the Armed Forces and the enactment of Total Mobilization, gearing all of our resources to war preparations. Unfortunately we do not have enough spare political capital to fulfil all of their demands but surely their requests for the outlawing of political rallies and trade-union strikes, military intervention in outlawed rallies and gatherings, the restriction of people gatherings to certain schedules subordinated to prior consent of the government and banishment of suspected guevarist organizations can be implemented without hurting our ideals and our commitment to keeping Democracy too much, plus we can count with many militarist votes."

Suddenly, the tappers rose up, overcame the small private thugs and, in a hastily organized assembly, declared unanimously to strike until the government agreed to cave in to their demands such as revocation of the proposed Lei Militar de Segurança Nacional, called as Lei da Mordaça by its detractors, and better working/healthcare/living conditions. However, this happening wasn't limited only to that seringal, as the tappers of some seringais near by also went on strike in a quite coordinated manner, with the seringueiros (tappers) seizing the properties entirely. Some sources affirm that the new legislation, related to curb any non-sanctioned rallies and drafted to appease the militarists, is the main reason behind this strike, even though some military sources state that there's some evidences of foreign backing, refusing however to name the suspected foreign backer."

After a a few moments, he stepped into the direction of the office, still much frightened of disturbing the Iron General. After some words with the guards emphasizing the importance of that information he was bringing, a few moments nervously waiting outside the door and finally the guard came out of the room, allowing his entrance. \nSilently, the young officer entered the room and with a calm yet firm voice tone, gave a brief resume of what was happening to Cerqueira. 10 or so minutes of complete silence passed until he got up of his chair, wore his military quepe, gently knocked the door and whispered some orders to the same soldier that had entered before. Cordeiro Sousa could not hear the entirety of whatever Cerqueira had whisper but he captured a few fragments: "Military intervention", "deploy the troops in strategic places", "put all the commanders with their respective assigned forces in total readiness state" and "get me with President Cury in a secure phone line"."

What seemed to be a swift and easy path through which Cury's ambitious reformist ideas, brand new to a backward state such as Acre and yet to be evaluated outside of the planning sheets, could be transformed not only into official legislation but as effective government actions. However, the political atmosphere changed dramatically since the so-called Dias Branco Strike, whose outcome angered Militarists and Technocrats alike as their proposals were turned down by Cury himself after heated arguments, in which the government decided to surround striking seringais, starving them out into submission.  Cury's strategy worked, as he neither damaged his popular support by not brutally suppressing nor showed weakness conceding to strikers' demands. This "independent" move caused a special unpleasant consequence, namely the rising of a small organized opposition movement inside the ANC, currently unable to cripple any of his ongoing reform proposals due to its small size but can be a thorn in our side if left unchecked.  Cury, the embodiment of Nacionalista Party core ideas and beliefs aside from his own, hoped to not resort to any old political vices that tainted many politicians before him. The times, however, they are a-changin’, different times require less idealistic and more pragmatic methods, especially in the wild political arena. A list of  "malleable" politicians plus adequate doses of blackmailing, sinecures, cronyism, boondoggles, bribes, some physical "convincing" of the most recalcitrant ones and other "special measures", all of that done the most discreet manner possible, ensuring our congressional ship goes steady under careful steering, approving the government agenda."

The main reason that motivated its creation, according to prominent members of the cabinet present in the inaugural ceremony, was the need of a specialized body to manage the many indigenous populations in our territory, contact the most isolated ones and ensure firm alliances with those populations, protect native communities, make sure their integration process in to the Acrean society goes smoothly and map their locations to ensure the government can give proper coverage to the majority of them. However, there are rumors, from some sources inside the FUNAI itself, that the agency, known unofficially in some intellectual circles as Fundação Nacional de Inteligência (Foundation of National Intelligence) in a clear mockery to the official name, has a covert purpose: coopt members of these populations as special agents and military aides, making use of their vast knowledge in some fields labeled as vital to our military such as their knowing of Acrean geography (land, fluvial and terrain), jungle tracking and reconnaissance, survival within the jungle environment and jungle warfare (including guerrilla tactics), in which natives excel. These claims have been thoroughly denied by official government sources and deemed as "lies spread by guevarist propaganda", "conspiracy theories of lunatics" and "rabid racist dogs that want to keep the native's former status of second-class citizens"."

In short, Che controls Rondônia only nominally, keeping his grasp on the territory by intimidation of the residual populace and the promise of reprisal in case of rebellion. Nevertheless, we cannot disregard the possibility of greater military presence in the south, where clashes between Che and the Brazilian Military Junta have been reported.\nOne particular incursion into Rondônia reported that large stretches of the Madeira-Mamoré railroad remain active on a small scale, operated and maintained by the civilian populace for everyday needs, by taking it the team reached as far as Porto Velho before retreating, encountering no opposition. The ERN appears to be unaware or indifferent to the railroad’s existence or operational status.\nD.P.24 proposes a covert operation to connect Acre’s existing railroad network to the Madeirá-Mamoré, providing direct access to Porto Velho and Guajará Mirim, depending on the success of the operation the network could be expanded as far as Riberalta. Although risky this could provide us direct access to the behind enemy lines causing major disruption of their frontline during an invasion attempt of Acre, as well as excellent support for our infantry if we were to ever set foot in Rondônia. \n\nDetails on estimated cost provided in the annex."

A president might rule it all, but he couldn’t rule alone, first came the issue of native equality, the discussion went smoothly, reservations, special protections, ownership and distribution of land, the agreements turned to the river, the transport, and the rubber, the conversation turned seamlessly to the ways of trade policy still superficially focusing on the natives, the talk was mainly of standardization, the assistant watched in confusion as the discussion quickly devolved into haggling and then further into a screaming match about trade standards and most importantly about Manaus, no deal would be reached on it, for now at least. As the gentlemen left half satisfied Marques casually turned to the assistant and said..."

ACRMarques.2.B:0 "Maybe it's time for you to leave." 

ACRMarques.3.t:0 "Hardly an Agreement"
ACRMarques.3.d:0 "It was a damn hot day and it would be a damn bad day if this didn’t go to plan. Marques knew that all too well, Marshall Cerqueira, General Kalume, and the military establishment at large didn’t trust him in the slightest, but he was cautiously optimistic, the Militarists seemed open for a compromise, confirmation of the president’s opposition to Che in exchange for confirmation of the Army’s Loyalty, a fair compromise. It was almost time, Kalume thought, he wondered if the Rio Branco Palace had air conditioning, he marched up the stairs and entered the office, lord, was it suffocating, the General sat down in front of the President and spoke firmly “Greetings, Mr. President, as you might know, we have a proposal” he paused for a short second struggling to sound poetic and deep in the hopes of winning over the playmaker turned chief of state. “Both of us know a man may rule, but he can’t rule alone, especially without an army. As a representative of the Militarist party and the military in general, we kindly ask you to help us to help you, General Cerqueira has some requests for you in exchange for our help, given your inclinations, working with you entails sacrifices." Both men knew this was but theatrical flair, nonetheless it was far better then getting the front door kicked in by Cerqueira, again."
ACRMarques.3.A:0 "Give in just a bit, for now."
ACRMarques.3.B:0 "Secure their loyalty, for now."

ACRMarques.10.t:0 "Che Approves!"
ACRMarques.10.d:0 "Our proposition has been successfully approved by Che Guevara, and trade can now flow from the rivers under the control of the ERN, the first step towards a cordial relationship with our comrades in the south has been made, with resources arriving on a fast pace on Acre. Soon, let us hope that more trade agreements be made so our nations can thrive together."
ACRMarques.10.A:0 "A Toast to our Southern Friends!"

ACR_cerqueira.1.t:0 "Edgar Cerqueira Elected As First President of Acre"
ACR_cerqueira.1.d:0 "With the drafting and signing of the new Acrean Constitution of 1967, nearly two dozen of the Senate's previously empty seats have been filled as each choice and amendment passed empowered its proposing faction. With a now full Senate and a Constitution enacted, a vote within the chamber has been held to elect the nation's President for the next 4 years.\n\nThe victor is Edgar Cerqueira, one of the nation's most prominent militarists and a former army commander. Extremely critical of communism and the Technocratic faction, who Cerqueria has decried as socialist sympathizers, the strongman has called for major military buildup and the formation of a professional Acrean army to fend off raids and destroy the ERN. Cerqueira is also seemingly more friendly to the Brazilian Military Junta than the other two candidates of the election, leading to fears amongst opposition members that he will sell out the Republic to Brasilia - claims that the new President has fiercely denied."
ACR_cerqueira.1.a:0 "God Save the Republic."
