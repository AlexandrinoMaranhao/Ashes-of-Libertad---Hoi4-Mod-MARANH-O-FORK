 CoariIntroduction.1.t:0 "How did we get here?"
 CoariIntroduction.1.d:0 "The River of Gold, the Land of Gas, River of the Gods, The Pearl of Solimões; Those are all names once given to the city of Coari, the 5th largest and one of the most isolated towns in northern Brazil, located just west of Manaus in the dense heart of the Amazon rainforest, but what makes this city shine also came to be it's own downfall, following the 1962 military coup that deposed President João Goulart and the following civil war that still rages on, Coari came to be one of the cities occupied by the Amazonian Military Command, one of the Brazilian Army's regional defence forces, in an effort to maintain peace during a time of crisis.\n \nIn 1965 however with the prolongment of the war, infighting between Junta and Loyalist forces inside the ranks of the Amazonian Military Command and the lack of men in the southern frontlines forced it to be recalled from Coari and the Amazon as a whole, stationed only in Manaus, Parintins, Nhamundá and Belém, however their mark stayed behind.\n \nBe it for lack of supervision, overdeployment, undersupplying of troops or a combination of all made so the army's treatment of the civilian population turned harsher and harser by the day, beatings on the streets and sporadic fire were seen around the city between loyalist and Junta aligned soldiers, with civilians getting caught in the crossfire, such horrors however cannot compare to what came on March 1st 1965, 3 days before the troops retreat from the the Amazon and 1 day before the start of the Carnaval.\n \nDuring a communal dinner organized by the local church as a departure gift for the soldiers, unbeknowst to all, liquor got smuggled in, men got drunk, tensions escalated and soon blood was shed and by the end of the night the Solimões river reflected the orange light of the burning city.\n \nThe pillaging carried on for a day, few houses were spared, women were stripped from their husbands and children; The following day the soldiers departed earlier then expected, carrying with them trophies as if taken from life long enemy's homes, and the Pearl of Solimões was left behind without it's shine."

 CoariIntroduction.2.t:0 "The Pearl of Solimões."
 CoariIntroduction.2.d:0 "If you go up the Amazon river departing from Manaus there isn't much to see besides the seemingly endless torrent of dark brown water ahead of you and the lush green forest surrounding you, at least for the untrained eye that is, those who can appreciate it's beauty may notice the endless colorful tropical birds dotting the sky every sunset and sunrise in great flocks, the alien like lifestyle of the villages of interconnect stilt houses living off the rivers, and after a whole day of travel the meeting point where the dark waters of the Negro river meet with the calm, light brown Solimões at the birthplace of the Amazon.\n \nIf you decide to turn left and go up the muddy brown waters of the Solimões however you will be surprised with what you find, for in the heart of that dense isolated jungle lives a treasure of inimmaginabile value, a pearl that shines so bright it's light guides the lost like a lighthouse towards the warm welcoming embrace of a kind and hardworking people, and it's name is Coari.\n \nA wonder built by God fearing men who like the pioneers of the American Frontier dedicated their lives to settling this wild land and taming it into something worth calling home, and by God they did it, the Harbor is the gateway from which the stones that built the Colonial style Getúlio Vargas Square and the pride of the town, the Friary of Sant'Anna came from, where man from all over the world teach and guide a new generation of priests."

 CoariIntroduction.3.t:0 "The White Linned Mayor."
 CoariIntroduction.3.d:0 "Born in the dry and misery-fertile lands of the Brazilian northeast, Montoril quickly fell in love with the wet and mysterious north when he moved there at an early age, his childhood however would not be an easy or happy one becoming an orphan and having to look after his brothers working as a black and goldsmith, police officer, dentist and finally enrolling in politics during the short lived tenentist levants of '32, when he became Military Mayor of Coari following the murder of it's former mayor, that however sparked his legendary career in Coarense politics and the Golden age of the city that, under his guidance, has managed to thrive for decades and emerge with prominence from the deep, dark jungle. As an old man in '61 he was elected again as mayor after a long hiatus from politics as if destiny itself put him in charge of his beloved little town once again in a time of desperation. During Coari's sacking on March 1st 1965 his reign almost came to a bloody end if not for the civilian mob that surrounded and protected him and his office during the chaos, a showcase of the people's gratitude and love for him. To anyone outside of the now desolate city this may seems... weird, but the undeniable only reason Coari still stands, even if only half alive, is the presence and guidance of this well dressed man.
 CoariIntroduction.3.A:0 "Charming fella"
 Coari.4.t:0 "Fish and Bananas."
 Coari.4.d:0 "The door to Montoril's office was heavily guarded day and night, the guards never had to do anything but look angrily at people that came too close, but they nonetheless carried military assalt rifles scavenged from the Carnaval sacking all those years ago, still, those are hardly necessary, no one would ever dare to do any harm to the mayor, still Montoril insisted on having them watch over him day and night.\nThe door opened slightly, the face of one of the guards swooped in.\n''Sir, Father Hirsch has paid you a visit.''\n \nMontoril rose his head from the letter he spent the last hours drafting, visibly surprised by the visitor.\n''Hirsch? What is he doing here at this time of night, shouldn't he be at the dinner?''\n \n''That's... why he came sir, you haven't shown up there for more then a month now, he brought you something to eat.''\nThe lack of formalities wasn't seen as disrespect by Montoril in any way, those men cared for him like a son cares for his father, and he understood that, the guard opened the door, revealing a platter of cooked bananas and fish wrapped in a white cloth, still steaming hot, not fancy but that's all they had now.\n''Should I leave it at your table or...''\n \n''No, no'' Montoril interrupted, he sighed looking at the piles of useless drafts and unsent letters addressed to Brasília, it's weird to think that while trying to help the town he distanced himself from it's people, always locked in his office, always drafting another plan to make them last one more week afloat.\n \n''Has Hirsch left the building yet?'' He asked.\n \nThe guard looked back for a moment to check. ''I believe not sir, I can hear his voice downstairs.'' The guard replied."

 Coari.2.d:0 "''Hey, do you want to be a man? If yes, you need to hold this gun and fire.'' \n \nThat was Arthur, Montoril's mouthpiece for getting some new people to the Coari Defense Militia, brigade number 2, platoon number 1. The young man who held the rifle barely expected the weight going against his shoulder and body, breathing in carefully to save face, trying to look as manly as possible. He looked forward to the target - a small bottle, rusted and forgotten by time - and breathed out, firing the spare bullet against the bottle, the caliber slowly entering the glass and shattering it into a million pieces. The young man lost his balance due to the recoil, running back and his ear ringing from the loud crackle of the rifle's bolt. His friends looked and laughed at him, yet their turn was coming too. The second young man came, confident and ready to shoot, reloading his bolt-action rifle and aiming to the second bottle. He aimed with certainty, and shot with the same certainty, the rifle making his arm lunge backwards and make him trip on himself. The last teenager, the most confident of them all, prepared his shot and fired at the third bottle. He stood triumphantly, looking at the shattered bottle and a small bird which he had also shot by accident."
 Coari.2.A:0 "We have a long way to go, kids."
 Coari.1.t:0 "It's a long, long way to Santarém."
 Coari.1.d:0 "''How long will the journey take?'' Asked the old lady.\n \n''If we're luck just 4 days but with canoes I doubt it will be so quick, specially with all the weight.'' Answered the young man. ''Don't worry mom, I'll be fine.'\n \nHe held her wrinkled hands together in a caring gesture looking her gently in the eyes. ''I'll be back by the end of the week, don't worry, no one will risk their lives for a fancy sofa and a new pair of shoes.''\n \nHe smiled proudly of his own joke but it had no effect on the old lady, she stuttered for a moment not knowing what to say, alternating her attention between her son and the canoes and small vessels filled to the brim with furniture, chests carrying small useless trinkets and few things with actual value.\n \n''You are not coming back, are you son?''\n \n''Of course I a-''\n \n''You didn't load anything to sell in Santarém besides your clothes, you're not going there to pay the militia, you're leaving us, aren't you son?''\n \nLurdes could be old but she kept her smarts and she knew her son well, while leaving he made the effort of not taking anything valuable to her, only his personal belongings, she knew damn well what was happening.\n \n''Mother, I... This city is dead, there's no hope left here anymore just look at what we are doing! Praying to god that a bunch of payed murderers will save us from getting murdered in exchange for our fucki- damned wardrobes.'' He gripped her harder. ''Once I get to Santarém I'll take a boat to Manaus, find a job in the plantations or maybe as a soldier of fortune, I will come back for you I promise but I can't stay in Coari anymore.''\n \nTears started to sprout in both as the weight of the lie came crashing down, the old lady held her son's hand against her face one last time and reached for something in her pocket, taking out a small silver object.\n \n''You forgot your father's tie clip in the drawer, I hoped you would get married wearing it just like he did but it may be worth something."\n She put it in his hand and closed it tight.\n \n''I didn't forget it mother...''"
 Coari.1.A:0 "''...I wanted you to have something to remember me and father.''"
 ACRIntroduction.1.t:0 "How did we get here?"
 ACRIntroduction.2.t:0 "The Republic, reborned."
 ACRIntroduction.3.t:0 "The white liquid of life."
 ACRIntroduction.1.d:0 "In the eve of the 19th century the revolutionary ideals of France and the liberal optimism of the United States made their way into the deep dark Bolivian jungle, giving birth to the first Republic of Acre, based on surprisingly modern ideals for such a backwaters place and time. \nNonetheless the light of such revolution would be quickly and repeatedly snuff out, first by the Bolivians, then Brazilians, and 3 more times the Republic would rise just to be stomped back into being a historical footnote in the history of Latin American republics, but even after it's visionary leaders are all long dead and buried and it's flags stolen and reapropriated the ideals created by this 'footnote' lives on to this day in the minds of the educated folk. \n \nIn 1962 the world would be brought to it's knees and in the process tirany would again come to Rio Branco, ironically though the same fire responsible for ending the might republics of France and America also rekindled the fires of revolution in the deep secluded Brazilian jungle."
 ACRIntroduction.2.d:0 "In 1962 federal troops marched on the streets of Brasília announcing the army coup, while some resisted and still resist to this day the state of Acre, elevated to a state from a Federal Territory just one year prior, was quickly overwhelmed by the local Junta Loyal garrison of the 4th Frontier Battalion who sieged Rio Branco Palace until the then governor, José Augusto de Araújo, surrendered peacefully to the federal troops passing the tittle of Governor to Edgar Cerqueira and being taken to Brasília to await judgement in prison. \nHowever, as conflicts against Republican forces escalated into open civil war Acre's military occupation by the Amazonian Military Command came to an abrupt end when the occupation force was recalled from the state to serve more actively in the war, leaving the rebellious state essentially independent, but also very, very vulnerable. \nAs soon as the Brazilian troops left danger came from Bolivia once again as Ce Guevara's ragtag of guerrilla fighters pushed north into Brazil, being bravely (and miraculously) stopped in Brasiléia by a combined force of civilian militias and the former 4th Frontier Battalion, and in the wake of such victory Acrean nationalism was catapulted back into mainstream, Edgar's military government became more of a suggestion then rule as his forces were now outnumbered and outgunned by victorious proud militia man, and seeing themselves abbandoned by the Brazilian Government and with a renewed sense of national pride Acre declared it's formal independence from Brazil, taking it's first step towards a becoming the America's newest Republic."
 ACRIntroduction.3.d:0 "Latex is the blood of the Republic, for millenia before the arrival of Europeans natives would turn it into balls for the children to play or use it for basic repairs and tool making, in the 19th century this industry boomed as vehicles and machines in Europe and the United States now required rubber to function, bringing much wealth to those who sold it and much suffering for those who harvest it. \nAs expected the republic's economy isn't an industrial one, far from it, instead Acre's economy is entirely dependent on the renewed rubber trade which while profitable (specially after the complete collapse of the production of synthetic rubber in Europe and the US) is also a very, very exploitative job, tappers are constantly being exposed to every danger the jungle can offer from disease to wild animals, often away from city centers where medical help can be offered if ever needed, wages are low and life conditions even worse not to mention the impact these rubber plantations have on nature and the native communities that cover much of Acre's territory. \nThese inhuman conditions are fundamentally against the original believes of the Republic but still we are dependent on trade with Manaus if we want to prosper and grow in power and relevance, time will tell if the ideals of old will be upheld or forgotten when faced with reality."
 ACRIntroduction.1.A:0 "A light that won't die down easily."
 ACRIntroduction.2.A:0 "The first step is usually the hardest one."
 ACRIntroduction.3.A:0 "The elastic and rubbery reality of life."
 ACR.1.d:0 "With all senators united in Rio Branco work on the Constitution has begun, while the ideals of the original Acre Republic are highly regarded amongst all, and the old laws imposed by the Brazilian Government are still used as a basis, this is a time of great change and radical unexpected reforms could end up being put in place if so desired by the senators. \n \nThe 22 senators here united come from all parts of Acre and some are even from beyond it's borders, as a result no one has any strong relationship with anyone else, mix that with the fact that Acre doesn't have a strong political history makes so there are no existing parties those senators can affiliate themselves with, instead, new parties are being created as the constitution is written and senators get to meet each other, grouping into 3 groups of like minded individuals, the Nationalists, who value the original values of the Republic and are united by a strong sense of national pride, the Militarists, mainly members of the former 4th Frontier Battalion or militia members bitter from the attack from Ce Guevara who believe the only way to save Acre's sovereignty is my turning it into a true fighting force capable of defending itself, and the Technocrats, a loose group of intellectuals, poets, artists and social activists coming from the lower levels of society, while some brand them as communist they advocate for better more humane work conditions for tappers and much needed social reforms. \n \nOnce the constitution is signed an indirect election will take place where the senators will vote for one of them to become president, the candidate of the party with most seats will be granted the honor of becoming the first President of the Acre Republic, finally ending the period of Provisional Government."
 ACR.2.d:0 "The Senate has come to the conclusion that integrating the native communities into "civilized" world is not something we can afford to do, at least not in the present time, such worries are mainly good hearted however with few talks of "racial superiority", concerns are mainly economical and of the well being of the native communities as integrating them would not only disturb their traditional way of life but also expose them to disease and exploitation from land lords, they are best left alone, the question is, how alone?"
 ACR.3.d:0 "Talks of equality have won the Senate, while some argue that complete integration of the natives could cause a disturbance of their traditional way of life and exposition to unnecessary evils, it was ultimately decided that all men are equal inside the Republic independent of color, language or birthplace, however even inside the Senate racism against native Americans is very much present, the question now is if those ideals of equality should be forced and indoctrinated into the population's mindset or only enforced by law."
 ACR.4.d:0 "Words are dangerous, Brazil's failure in stopping the spread of ideas was what created the Acre Republic in the first place and in an ironic twist we must not commit the same mistake as them, the state needs a strong hand over the few media outlets it has at its disposal, the question is how hard should we grip them?"
 ACR.5.d:0 "Our nation was founded in the mold of liberal democracy, the same as the once mighty United States of America, and as such we cannot allow ourselves to do such tirany as to supress the people's right to speak and protest, even if against us from time to time, as such Freedom of Speech shall be a guaranteed right inside our borders, the question now is, how "free" should this freedom be?"
 ACR.6.d:0 "The elefant in the room, worker's rights, heated debate between Technocrats and the rest eventually culminated into a victory for the plantation elites and, to a degree, downright sociopaths, going against the 1888 Áurea law that abolished slavery in Brazil a minority favors radical reforms that would allow landowners to essentially own workers as servants for minimal wages, a new form of serfdom akin to what can be seen in Manaus's unregulated rubber plantations, few favor such radical reforms that distance themselves so much from our libertarian ideals, but maybe some men shouldn't be so free as others if that's for the betterment of the state, the question now is, how far should we go?"
 ACR.7.d:0 "The elefant in the room, worker's rights, heated debate between Technocrats and the rest eventually culminated into a victory for the social justice warriors, a not insignificant step towards betterment of the people's lifes, the question now is, how hard should we push those reforms?"
 ACR.8.d:0 "The days following the withdrawal of federal troops from Acre were days of chaos and desperation, Edgar's authority broke down as the people organized into militias for and against Ce Guevara's iminent invasion, fighting between syndicalist tapper militias led by Wilson de Souza and the former 4th Frontier Battalion broke out in the streets of Xapuri, and once the main attacking force from the red army came intense resistance was made on Brasiléia and Rio Branco, ultimately repelling Ce's forces and saving Acre from a fate akin to Rondônia's in a glorious although costly victory, Wilson was banished from Acre, the Republic was consolidated and Ce Guevara went back to Bolivia to lick his wounds, a tense peace now exists, another attack in the near future seems eminent and Ce's forces grow stronger by the day, we all wait and pray that when the day comes we are able to best them back once again."
 ACR.9.d:0 "Acting as independent defense forces, many militias still roam the country side vowing to protect citizens from the red Menace to the south, still such unregulated fighting force is prone to making "unfortunate accidents" like shooting civilians "accidentally", occasionally looting entire villages or declaring innocent people enemies of the state and communist sympathizers, they have to be organized into a disciplined fighting force and fast before things spiral out of control, and the first step in doing so is regulating recruitment."

The revolutionaries have been getting more daring, doing exercises near our border, scouting our positions, firing a constant amount of shots across the line and finally starting to bring heavier equipment. Needless to say we are, definitely, the next target in their sights. Whether we have prepared or not does not matter, for if all was in vain, our Republic shall never prosper again."
