 ParaCabanos.2.t:0 "Factory Sabotaged by Cabanos!"
 ParaCabanos.2.d:0 "Leandro was a simple man, everyday he woke up at 9, had a good sandwich for breakfast, kissed his wife and kids goodbye, and biked to his work. There he met his friends and co-workers, with whom he shared good laughs and helped build a better future for the motherland. He loved his job. Today, however, Leandro woke up a few minutes early and headed to work before his shift started, after all, he might find a good friend and keep updated on the local news! Sadly, all that Leandro found was the constuction site engulfed in flames, and no one in sight. The simple man kneeled and cried: Who'll feed his family? How will he make money to pay for his children's school? All he could do at the moment was be sad and curse those that broke up the motherland in thousands of factions, before sighing and asking god if someday things will look better. Until then, Leandro and other men like him will unfortunately suffer from industrial sabotage and war between the bickering factions of the chaotic Brazilian land."
